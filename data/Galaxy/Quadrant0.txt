REGION: Quadrant Zero

Starfleet designation for the innermost core of Federation space. Includes Sector 001, Starbase 4, and Memory Prime. Quadrant Zero duty is considered a dishonor for Starfleet's foremost ships. This area of space is not actually a Quadrant, but simply nicknamed that because it included four low-excitement destinations.
