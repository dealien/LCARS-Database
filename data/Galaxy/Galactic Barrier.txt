ANOMALY: Galactic Barrier

Phenomenon surrounding the Milky Way Galaxy. It defied conventional analysis, even though it could be seen and felt once a ship got close enough. When the U.S.S. Stargazer passed through the barrier in 2333, there were no gravimetric distortions and no subspace field stress, and optical scanners on the starship were the only ones registering anything. The barrier had the potential to turn people with extrasensory perception into godlike beings, such as Geirrod Agnarsson, Commander Gary Mitchell or Dr. Elizabeth Dehner, but innovations in deflector technology since the days of the S.S. Valiant and the Enterprise NCC-1701 rendered this danger irrelevant.     
The crew of the S.S. Valiant gave the galactic barrier the unofficial name of Big Red which they tried to cross in 2069.
