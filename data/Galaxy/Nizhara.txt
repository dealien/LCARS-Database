Nizhara is a gas giant in the Sonada Sin system and the home of a species called Nizhrak’a. In 2333, it was not yet a member of the United Federation of Planets, but the Federation was courting it for its strategic location near Cardassian space.  Ensign Jiterica’s presence in Starfleet was an attempt to see if Nizhrak’a and humanoids could establish a mutually beneficial relationship.
