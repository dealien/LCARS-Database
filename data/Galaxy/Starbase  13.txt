STATION: Starbase 13

Federation starbase.  The U.S.S. Enterprise-D was prefabricated at Starbase 13.  In 2359, Miles O’Brien served a short tour in dry docks at Starbase 13 while the Enterprise-D was being constructed.  He was so impressed with the ship that when it was finished five years later, he requested to be posted on her.
