SYSTEM: Oneo Madrin
SECTOR:
QUADRANT:

Binary star system with an accretion bridge and a sinkhole. Both stars were Sol-class, named Alpha Oneo Madrin and Beta Oneo Madrin. The system had seventeen planets. In 2333, the research vessel Belladonna, which was assigned to the system, came too close to the bridge and sent out a distress call that was picked up by an Andorian cargo vessel and relayed to Starbase 63. The U.S.S. Stargazer was ordered to help the Belladonna and found out that the science ship had been partially swallowed by the sinkhole.
