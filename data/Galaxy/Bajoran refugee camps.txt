LOCATION: Bajoran refugee camps

Camps set up on Bajor during and after the Occupation. Since many villages were destroyed by the Cardassians, the inhabitants were forced to relocate to refugee camps. As of early 2370, there was still no exact count of how many refugee camps were left on Bajor, though Starfleet was working with the provisional government to speed up the resettlement procedures. Commander Sisko commented that most camps had been emptied by 2370, but he may have been mistakenly referring to labor camps. In early 2370, a deadly fever killed many refugees in the Kaladrys Valley until Doctor Julian Bashir was able to find a cure for the disease. Bajorans placed their refugee camps as apart as possible so that the inhabitants would have a fighting chance of supporting themselves on the land.
