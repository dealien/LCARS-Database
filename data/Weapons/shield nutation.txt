TECHNOLOGY: shield nutation

A way of varying the shield frequency phase rotation. In 2366, shield nutation was used to increase The U.S.S. Enterprises shield effectiveness against the Borg. By using different frequencies at different times the Borg were unable to identify the frequency being used, therefore unable to penetrate the shields with their tractor beams and transporters. This only temporarily worked though as the Borg ships were able to overcome the effects in just a few short minutes.
