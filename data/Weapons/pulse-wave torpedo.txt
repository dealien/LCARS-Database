WEAPONS: pulse-wave torpedo

A ship-mounted explosive weapon. In 2169, a Vulcan spacecraft attempted to close a subspace rupture with such a device. When a similar rupture was believed to be forming near Deep Space Nine in 2369, a pulse-wave torpedo was again used to attempt to correct the problem.
