RECREATION: Holodeck and Holosuite

The generic name, especially in use aboard Federation starships, for the "smart" virtual reality system as evolved by the 2360s - a technology that combines transporter, replicator, and holographic systems. The programs, projected via emitters within a specially outfitted but otherwise empty room, can create both "solid" props and characters as well as holographic background to evoke any vista, any scenario, and any personality - all based on whatever real or fictional parameters are programmed. While personal holoprograms relieve the stress and isolation of shipboard life for crew personnel, Holodecks are also used for tasks ranging from scientific simualtion to tactical or even covert training. Off starships, many commercial users have equipped facilities with so-called Holosuites. 
Holodecks were equipped with safety protocols to prevent participants from being seriously injured or killed by holographic characters or objects. The Bynars devised a way to significantly upgrade the interactive qualities and adaptiveness of the holodeck programming in 2364. While the creation of a holodeck program could use information contained in a personnel file, like 3D images, voice patterns, and psychological profile, using such information was considered to be a serious invasion of privacy. It also became a crime to break into someone else's running program in commercial applications.
