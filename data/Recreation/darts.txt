RECREATION: darts

Indoor game of skill involving the throwing of pointed projectiles at a circular target. The game originated on Earth during the middle ages and became very popular on that planet during the 19th and 20th centuries. In 2371 Chief Miles O'Brien installed a dart board in one of the cargo bays on station Deep Space Nine. A few weeks later he convinced Quark to put up the dartboard in his bar. O'Brien even enjoyed a remarkable 46-game winning streak in late 237 during which he felt that he was "in the zone." Chief Miles O'Brien and Doctor Julian Bashir played a regular weekly game of darts thereafter.
