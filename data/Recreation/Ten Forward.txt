RECREATION: Ten Forward

The proper name of the officers lounge on the U.S.S. Enterprise-D. It derived it's name from its location at the "forward"-most location of the vessel and on level "ten" of the saucer. The bar was managed by Guinan who kept a private stock of alcoholic beverages to augment the typical replicated items being offered. Crewman Ben was a civilian that also worked in the lounge and befriended both the senior and junior staff of the starship. The lounge featured a large bar with stools, several tables and chairs, some benches along the sides, and a riser lifting up the one area of the lounge under the forward windows. Ten Forward was designated as one of the emergency shelter areas on the starship, and on one occassion Lieutenant Worf gave birth to Molly O'Brien when Keiko O'Brien went into labor during a power loss emergency suffered by the starship. The lounge was modified a few times to allow for musical recitals performed by crewmen.

Reference: 
While other Galaxy-class vessels will have a lounge in the same location and same layout, Ten Forward only existed on the one craft. The set was reused for the converted mess hall during the Voyager series.
