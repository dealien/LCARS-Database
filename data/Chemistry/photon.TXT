CHEMISTRY: photon

A quantum of electromagnetic radiation. The wave and particle behaviour displayed by photons led to the development of quantum theory on Earth. High energy photons, also known to be a part of gamma radiation, have been used to recrystalize dilithium. These photons were a by-product of nuclear fission reactors.
