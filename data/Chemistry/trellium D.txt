CHEMISTRY: trellium-D

Component used in the Delphic Expanse to insulate ships - it protects them from the mysterious anomalies that plague this area of space. According to chemist B'Rat, it is rare and difficult to process. B'Rat provided Captain Archer with the formula for synthesizing trellium-D - though he warned that it is very volatile in its liquid state. Trellium proved to be harmful to Vulcan citizens.
