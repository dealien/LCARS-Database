CHEMISTRY: kemacite

Substance that has many applications, depending on the level of refinement. Highly unstable and usually dangerous. When exposed to nuclear radiation kemacite can cause unusual temporal phenomena. Smuggling kemacite was a serious offence.
It was one of the key components in the Xindi weapon and was produced by a Xindi-Sloth plant led by Gralik. In 2372 Quark attempted to smuggle kemacite aboard his ship, Quark's Treasure.

Reference: Little Green Men, The Shipment
The website spelled this item as kemocite and made reference to the Xindi use; while the book spoke of the Ferengi use. It is likely that this is still the same item and that the website spellied it wrong by accident.
