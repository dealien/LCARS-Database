SHIPS: Merchantman
TYPE: transport

A small merchant cargo ship, chartered in 2285 by Klingon operative Valkris on a mission to transport stolen data on the Federation Project known as Genesis to the Klingon government. A rather short-lived mission to say the least, as after delivering said data to the Klingons, the Merchantman and all aboard were destroyed by Klingon Commander Kruge. 

Reference: The Search for Spock 
The Merchantman was never referred to by name during the film. The name is from the script only. The Merchantman model, designed by Nilo Rodis and built at Industrial Light & Magic was re-used several times as various "guest" spaceships in The Next Generation.
