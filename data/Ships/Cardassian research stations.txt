STATIONS: Cardassian Research stations

The Cardassian Union uses a variety of station designs for developing new technologies and enhancing current ones. A distinctive station was the Quantum Research facility built by Gul Kantar for developing technology to create fluidic gates, which was destroyed by Chancellor Martok. There are three other types seen within large space communities.
One type is charged with the task of creating new features for existing ships like tachyon detection.
