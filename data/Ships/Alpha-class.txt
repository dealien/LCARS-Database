CLASS: Alpha
TYPE: carrier

A Romulan carrier rarely seen. It is speculated that the Star Empire may have only built one or two of these incredibly large vessels. They have only been seen from a distance with telescopic sensors so schematic details are not available, even dimensions are not able to be accurately judged.
