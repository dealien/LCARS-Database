This orbiting spacecraft was the vessel that carried the first Terran into space. The craft orbited for 108 minutes, for one Earth revolution, at an apogee of 302.3 kilometers and a perigee of 176.3 kilometers. This historic first kept Russia in the lead in the “space race” between the planetary super-powers.
