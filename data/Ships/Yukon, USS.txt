SHIPS: Yukon, U.S.S.
CLASS: Danube
REGISTRY: NCC-74602

Runabout posted to Deep Space 9, apparently replacing the exploded Orinoco. Major Kira Nerys and Chief Miles O'Brien used this craft on an inspection tour of the Bajoran colonies along the Cardassian border when they discovered a Klingon attempt to mine the area with cloaked weapons. They encountered the I.K.S. Korinar protecting the covert plan.
It was destroyed later by the U.S.S. Defiant when a Founder, impersonating Dr. Julian Bashir, tried to detonate a trilithium bomb in the Bajoran sun and wipe out the system, including a massive Alpha Quadrant fleet defending against a feared Dominion/Cardassian force.
