SHIPS: Nightingale

Nickname given to a Kralyor humanitarian aid vessel while under the command of Ensign Harry Kim from the U.S.S. Voyager. The vessel was encountered while an away team aboard the Delta Flyer intercepted a distress call and rescued it from aggressive forces. The ship was ordered to provide aid to a planet within the Delta Quadrant that was under blockade by the Annari. The Nightingale was equipped with a cloaking device, a valuable target for the Annari, but had minimal weapons otherwise, and even the cloak was plaqued with technical problems. The Nightingale did complete its mission and Kim returned to Voyager.
