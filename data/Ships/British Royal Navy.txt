FLEET: British Royal Navy

The navy of the nation of Great Britain on Earth.  Still existed into the twenty-second century.  Most of the male members of the Reed family enlisted in it, but Malcolm Reed defied family tradition by joining Earth's Starfleet.
On October 11, 1776, confronted the United States Continental Navy (including the sloop-of-war Enterprise under the command of Captain Israel Daniel Dickenson) at Valcour Island.  The Royal Navy consisted of one "two-hundred tonner", a full-rig with twenty-four pounder cannons, as well as no less than twenty-four gunboats, a radeau, and a large number of Native American canoes.  All in all, it was said that the tiny Continental Navy (consisting of fifteen ships) was facing fifty-three British vessels.  Although the Continental ships fought valiantly, they were outmatched, and after sunset things looked very grim for them.  However, they used a heavy fog which flowed into the harbor late that night to escape.  The next morning, the British Royal Navy found an empty harbor waiting for them.  {Historical accounts show that the British Royal Navy, after searching the empty harbor, later caught up again with the American fleet, destroying many of the U.S. vessels attempting to reach Fort Ticonderoga.
