SHIPS: Spitfire

A gunboat in the United States Continental Navy in October, 1776.  The fleet was under the command of General Benedict Arnold, and consisted of three schooners, four galleys, eight fifty-four foot gondalas, and a sloop-of-war (the Enterprise), sixteen ships in all.  On October 11, along with the rest of the fleet, clashed with the British Royal Navy at Valcour Island.

Reference: Veil at Valcour
While it was referred to as a "gunboat" in this story, historical accounts identify the Spitfire more precisely as a gondala type vessel.
