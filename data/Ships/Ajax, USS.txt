Jean-Luc Picard's friend from the Academy, Corey Zweller, was assigned to this ship upon graduating. In 2333 he was promoted to be the ship's second officer. He had a dom-jot table installed into the ship's recreation room with the permission from Captain Narth.
It was also one of two Starfleet ships whose increased warp engine performance is supposed proof of consultant Kosinski's theories, who went from there to the U.S.S Fearless to the Galaxy-class U.S.S. Enterprise-D on stardate 41263.1.
