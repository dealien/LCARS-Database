CLASS: D7
TYPE: Battle Cruiser

The workhorse of the Klingon Imperial Fleet in the 2250s and the predecessor to the K't'inga class. Koloth's ship was the I.K.S. Gr'oth. This design was shared with the Romulan Star Empire during the brief alliance between the two powers. 
These starships were equipped with warp drive and phase-disruptor style directed energy weapons. After the alliance with the Romulans they also became equipped with cloaking devices. The D7-class was later replaced with the K’t’inga-class battle cruiser.
