SHIPS: Bekkir ship

The ship contained 8 small black rectangular solids, each no bigger than a runabout.  These shapes were connected by spaghetti-like strands of tubing that looped along them.  Some of these loops were large enough for humanoids, others were power conduits.  Several tubes opened out into space and ended with wide open muzzles. The ship used a particle accelerator drive.  The ship could put a shield around a ship and/or station that prevented subspace communications.  Although the ship had no shields, phaser fire could not penetrate the hull, instead it reflected off of it. Their blue torpedoes could pass through shields.  A Bekkir ship visited Deep Space Nine in 2370, looking for a lost comrade, but Quark was able to convince them that their comrade was not aboard the station.
