The S.S. Lakul and Robert Fox carried El-Aurian refugees in 2294. Both ships were caught in and torn apart by the nexus energy ribbon. Some 47 out of 150 of the passengers from the Lakul were saved by the U.S.S. Enterprise-B, including Guinan and Dr. Tolian Soran. 

Reference: Generations 
The name of the second ship caught in the energy ribbon was seen on the Enterprise computer readout screen as the S. S. Robert Fox, for the Federation Ambassador from the episode "A Taste of Armageddon." The name was suggested by movie co-writer Ronald D. Moore.
