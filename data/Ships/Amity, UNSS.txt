SHIPS: U.N.S.S. Amity

In 2065 the U.N.S.S. Amity made the first contact with members of the Vulcan race during the rescue of a disabled Vulcan spacecraft that was adrift inside Earth's solar system. The crew of the vessel were unaware that a Vulcan scout ship had landed on the planet Earth and made the official First Contact because of the time delay for communications.
