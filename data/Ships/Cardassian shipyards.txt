STATIONS: Cardassian shipyards

Large drydocks used for the construction, repair, and recrewing of starships. The Obsidian Order secretly used shipyards to build Kelvan-class cruisers, despite the violation of their charter to do so. This scandal was discovered by the Maquis and they stole the U.S.S. Defiant to attack and expose the deception.
