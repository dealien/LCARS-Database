SHIPS: Shiku Maru 

One of seven ships to attempt communicate with the Tamarians in the last century before Enterprise did it in 2368. It, like the others left the encounter without incident since the two cultures were unable to communicate with the other. It was led by Captain Silvestri. There is no indication whether the ship was civilian or Starfleet.
