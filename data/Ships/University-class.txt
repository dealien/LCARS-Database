The U.N.S.S. Dewey and its sister ships were spacefaring schools, transporting students on a wide range of educational excursions, the best known being the still-popular “Worlds in Evolution” course that visited planets representing different stages of life-form development. A derivation of the Marshall-class using second generation warp propulsion, the Dewey and its fellow school-ships opened up a galaxy of educational opportunities.
