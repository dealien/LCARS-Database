Federation science ship. On stardate 47329.4, the Prometheus hosted Dr. Gideon Seyetik's Epsilon 199 stellar re-ignition project - ironic in light of the ship's mythic Greek namesake, who was tortured by Zeus for bringing fire to mortal humans. Normally not so fast a ship, Dax and O'Brien helped boost its top speed to warp factor 9.5 for a fast getaway in case of supernova failure. Seyetik killed himself in the project to set his unhappy yet mated-for-life wife free, after which she took the ship back to New Halana.
