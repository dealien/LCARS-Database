SHIPS: Space Ark
TYPE: transport

The Space Ark was originally conceived as a huge interplanetary industrial spaceworks, but its design flexibility was too narrow to keep pace with the rapidly evolving technology of the 21st century. Instead, it was cheaply purchased by a consortium of like-minded people, who refitted it as a multi-generational colony ship.
Only one of these ships survived its journey out of the Sol System; and that one stranded its passengers on a totally hostile planet.
