FLEET: Malon vessels

The U.S.S. Voyager encountered a few of the garbage scows used by this race. These heavy freighter are well armed for what would typically be considered a peaceful ship, and their weapons were a problem for the Intrepid-class Federation starship.
The observed Malon vessels traveled far from their homeworld in an attempt to dump highly dangerous antimatter waste created by their extremely mobile population. The controllers of these ships were unwilling to cooperate with Voyager's suggestions to dispose of their waste in more friendly ways because of the detrimental effects it would have on their personal finances. The Malon did try to find locations that they thought would not cause harm to others but were unwilling to change once local inhabitants were revealed. On a few occasions the U.S.S. Voyager destroyed the frieghters they encountered.
