STATIONS: Empok Nor
CLASS: Nor

Cardassian space station much like the one formerly known as Terok Nor. The Cardassian military abandoned it in 2372. The next year, a salvage team from Deep Space Nine went on a mission to the derelict station in order to obtain much needed parts. Unbeknownst to the team, three soldiers from the Cardassian First Battalion had been left behind in stasis. The soldiers were under the influence of a drug that made them extra aggressive and paranoid. 
The station was reused later by a group of Bajoran Pah-Wraith cultists that were exiled from their homeworld. Gul Dukat also took refuge on the station and imposed himself as their spiritual leader.
