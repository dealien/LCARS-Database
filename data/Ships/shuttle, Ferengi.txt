SHUTTLECRAFT: Ferengi shuttle

This two-person craft, also known as a Ferengi "pod," is mostly used for short-range transport. One such vessel was found in the distant Delta Quadrant by the U.S.S. Voyager, the transport used by Dr. Arridor and Kol when they were lost through the Barzan wormhole.
These machines have been known to breakdown and that rumor has also served in the Ferengi interest when they try to trick good samaritans into helping them, like the Starship Enterprise-D did in 2368 during their diplomatic mission that the Ferengi wanted to be involved in.
