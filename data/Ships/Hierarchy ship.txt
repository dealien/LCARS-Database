SHIPS: Overlooker

A ship in service to the Delta Quadrant civilization called the Hierarchy. The crew of these ships scanned their area for starships that they feel would be safe targets for boarding. Devro and Phlox operated on one such vessel when they came in contact with the U.S.S. Voyager. They could not access the starship’s internal sensors because of the heavy encryption, but were able to access the EMH and the records of his activities.
Phlox observed daydreams that the doctor was having and made the mistake that the Voyager would be an easy target. Once he learned of his mistake he alerted the Starfleet vessel of the incoming danger rather than alerting his superiors that would have punished him for his erroneous report earlier.
Playing on the advance warning the EMH took command of the Voyager and threatened to use the “photonic cannon” which the prior reports indicated was a powerful weapon. The Overlooker, in command of the Heirarchy vessel, retreated before he could be targeted by the superior weapon.
