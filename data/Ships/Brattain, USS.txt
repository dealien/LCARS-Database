SHIPS: Brattain, U.S.S.
CLASS: Miranda
REGISTRY: NCC-21166

"...A THREE HOUR TOUR, A THREE HOUR TOUR"
The ship was built at the 40 Eridani-A Starfleet Construction Yards/Yoyodyne Division and commissioned on stardate 22519.5. 
It was last heard from on stardate 44700.8. It was later found intact with no malfunctions but drifting in an unspecified binary system with its propulsion shut down. All but one of its 35 crew are found dead, killed by each others' hands as a result of the insanity induced by the telepathic calls of aliens likewise trapped across the Tyken's Rift. 

Reference: Night Terrors 
The dedication plaque on the Brattain's bridge stated its construction site and displayed the motto. The ship's name on the model was spelt Brittain by mistake. The model was a re-use of the U.S.S. Reliant from The Wrath of Khan, with minor modifications.
