SHIPS: Dinaali hospital ship

A fleet large flying hospitals operated by the Dinaali in orbit of their ecologically disastered planet. Chellick was the chief administrator of ship 4-2. These ships had limited resources and hired aliens like Chellick to step in and serve as impartial officers of these platforms. These stations instituted “Allocator” computer programs and “Treatment Coefficient” routines to prioritize and distribute the rationed supplies.
In 2377 the trader Gar sold the stolen Emergency Medical Hologram from the U.S.S. Voyager to this facility. The Federation starship came to claim it back. Before leaving, the EMH injected Chellick with a virus that the automated system deemed a low priority and classified Chellick as someone to die instead of receiving the medicine. Chellick changed the computer programming so that more persons stood a chance of being cured.
