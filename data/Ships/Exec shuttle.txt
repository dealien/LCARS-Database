SHUTTLECRAFT: 
TYPE: 3
MODEL:
MISSION:

This executive use craft is in normal use by Federation dignitaries and government officials and not by the Starfleet. These craft are larger than most shuttles and can carry a good number of passengers. These craft are often set up with cabins and offices so that the passengers can continue to work while en route to their destinations. 
A shuttle of this kind helped with the evacuation of the U.S.S. Enterprise-D from Veridian III after the starship's saucer crash landed there.
