SHIPS: fighters

Small armed craft usually employing one, two, or rarely three pilot crews. These craft are offensive in nature and can carry a variety of weapons for different missions. In some cases the ships can be modular, to allow flexibility for different jobs but often are designed to be dedicated to certain tasks. Most fighters lack warp capability and are limited to starbase, station, and planetary orbits providing protection.

Reference: all episodes of Star Trek
No episodes of Trek have depicted fighter craft, yet every military power on Earth has them. While Star Trek avoids such things in an attempt to make them look more evolved and “better” than the pettiness of war, it is a significant possibility that if the Starfleet truly existed that it would have fighter craft available too.
