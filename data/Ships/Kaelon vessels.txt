FLEET: Kaelon vessels

Two warships from this fleet were launched from the surface of Kaleon II to persuade the U.S.S. Enterprise-D to return Dr. Timicin to the planet.

Reference: Half a Life
These ships appear to be a re-use of the Jovis and Kallisko, which may also end up being reused several other times for Bajoran & Cardassian freighters, and for races in the Delta Quadrant and in Enterprise.
