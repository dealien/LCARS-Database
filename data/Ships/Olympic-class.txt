CLASS: Olympic
TYPE: medical frigate

These large starships were designed based on the older Daedalus-class craft but used much more advanced technology. They were commissioned to provide humanitarian aid and relief across Federation space and to neighboring systems.
In a possible future outlined by Q, the U.S.S. Pasteur was under the command of Captain Beverly (Crusher) Picard and sought to use her ship's humanitarian status to get past the Klingon border guards that prevented Federation ships from crossing the Romulan neutral zone. The Klingon hostilities increased against the Federation and the Romulans in this possible future.

The Olympic-class was originally going to be called the Hope-class, as an early version of the Pasteur's dedication plaque revealed. The miniature was designed and built by ILM art director Bill George.
