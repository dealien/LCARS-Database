SHIPS: Rubicon, U.S.S.
CLASS: Danube
TYPE: runabout
REGISTRY: NCC-72936

This Deep Space Nine replacement Runabout arrived soon after the abandonment of the U.S.S Mekong in the Gamma Quadrant amid the aftermath of the Cardassian-Romulan debacle at the Founders' Homeworld. Perhaps the rush delivery is the reason it arrived unnamed, since Commander Sisko was allowed to christen it. 
Among its more notable assignments is the infamous "little ship" mission to explore a rare subspace compression phenomenon ca. SD 51474.2. After the three-member crew were shrunk to a height of about two centimeters, they aided - even in miniature form - in retaking the U.S.S Defiant from Jem'Hadar capture. 
This ship conducted a bio-survey of Merik III with Dr. Bashir and Chief Miles O'Brien on stardate 49066.5. It was forced to crash land on Bopak III after the Jem'Hadar hit it with a subspace magneton pulse.
