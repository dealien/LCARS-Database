SHIPS: Akagi, U.S.S.
CLASS: Rigel
REGISTRY: NCC-62158

One of the 23 ships comprising Picard's armada that sets up a blockade to try and choke off Romulan support for the Duras faction in the Klingon civil war. In a ruse with the U.S.S. Hornet, the ships allowed a hole in the tachyon sensor net and then dropped back in wait. 

Reference: Redemption
The Akagi was named for the Japanese carrier that fought the American warship U.S.S. Hornet in the bitter Battle of Midway in World War II. Episode writer Ron Moore thought it fitting that in Star Trek's future the Akagi would be srving alongside the Hornet.
