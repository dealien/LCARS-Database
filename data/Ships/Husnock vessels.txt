SHIPS: Husnock vessels

Only one model of this extinct species spacecraft has been seen by Federation citizens. A ship five times more massive that a Galaxy-class starship and capable of at least Warp 9, completely unknown to the Federation until 2366. One such craft was discovered near the Delta Rana IV colony in 2366 when it began its attack. That ship killed the colony but was then destroyed by a non-corporeal alien on the planet, a Douwd who had taken up residence and married one of the citizens. The Douwd alien then destroyed the entire race in retaliation for the attack on the colony.
In order to discourage the Galaxy-class U.S.S. Enterprise from investigating the distress signals coming from the planet, a Douwd image of the ship was used to attack the Enterprise.
