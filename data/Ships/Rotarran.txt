SHIPS: Rotarran, I.K.S.
CLASS: K'Vort

General Martok commanded this Klingon bird-of-prey in 2373. A Klingon Bird-of-Prey, the Rotarran's demoralized crew and tawdry battle record took a sharp upturn after becoming General Martok's ship. Under Martok's leadership, the Rotarran battled the Jem'Hadar and rescued survivors from the Klingon battle cruiser I.K.S. B'Moth. The ship was also part of Sisko's bold move to retake Deep Space Nine from the Dominion. Alexander Rozhenko served aboard this ship.
