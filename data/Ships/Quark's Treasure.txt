SHUTTLECRAFT: Quark`s Treasure

A small Ferengi craft that had been owed to Quark by his mischievous cousin Gaila for 10 years before he received it in 2372. On its first mission out, Quark, Rom and Nog went to Earth but realized Gaila had sabotaged its warp drive, causing a temporal rift with the contraband kemacite aboard and throwing the trio back in time to Earth circa 1947.

Quark's ship was a re-use of the Ferengi shuttle model first seen in "The Price."
