SHIPS: Xindi-humanoid

The Xindi-Humanoid faction arguably uses the least formidable vessels in the Xindi fleet. 
While manueverable and armed with above-average weapons, the Humanoid ships pale in comparison to those of the Aquatics or the Reptillians.
Several of these ships, however, played key roles in ensuring a peace between Archer of Enterprise, joining forces with humans to stop the Xindi doomsday weapon from reaching Earth.
