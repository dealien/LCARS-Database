SHIPS: Bortas, I.K.S.
CLASS: Vor'cha

One of the three Klingon vessels that carried Captain Picard's request for Klingon assistance during the Galaxy-class starship Enterprise's investigation of a possible secret Romulan base at Nelvana III. The Bortas, along with help from two other Klingon ships, allowed the Enterprise to escape without instigating an interstellar war. 
This ship was also Gowron's flagship for the Klingon Civil War of 2367-2368, where Worf served as weapons officer.
