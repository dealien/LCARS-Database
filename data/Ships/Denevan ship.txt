SHIPS: Denevan ship

A dying Denevan native flew one of these small, one-person spacecrafts directly into the system's sun in 2267. The pilot had been infested with Denevan neural parasites, which were eradicated by the ultraviolent light of the sun. This information proved helpful when Spock was attacked by one of the creatures.
