SHIPS: Square Deal

A Lonation freighter that came through the Wormhole heavily damaged in 2370.  One bubble shaped warp pod was damaged, leaking a thin stream of coolant, and the other was sheared off entirely.  The metal hull was breached in a dozen places and in some places it was peeled away.  The cause of the ship's condition was unknown, although it is very possible the ship was just suffering from neglect.
