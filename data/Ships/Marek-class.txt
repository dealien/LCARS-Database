CLASS: Marek
TYPE: destroyer

Developed after the Defiant class, the Grazerite government decided to build its own set of warships to defend its territory against heavy aggressors like the Borg and the Dominion.
The starship features an oval saucer with a teardrop command module attached to the front. Each side is equipped with the typical forward facing crescent wings of Grazerite design.
The largest different between this destroyer and its model, the Defiant, are the placement of the warp nacelles. Even though they are nearly the same size as the Defiant, the Grazerite decided to place them in the aft section of the craft, adjacent to the sides of the central command section. Between the nacelles are the impulse drive engines and their fusion reactors and the fuel tanks. Directly ahead of that is the main engineering section of the craft, directly center of the main saucer.
The front of the craft is fitted with a detachable command section. It also features the craft's main deflector dish.
The sides of the saucer are equipped with pulse phaser emitters that are forward and rear facing. Using step one EPS conduits from the warp chamber they carry impressive firepower. This power is also channeled by the shield emitters embedded within the dorsal/ventral forward facing crescent wings. These wings also act as air stabilizers for atmospheric flight and have adjustable wing flaps for air flow control and flight maneuvers.
The sides of the craft have forward facing crescent wings that allow the ship to glide and fly easily. These wings feature anti-gravity emitters and tractor beam projectors that assist the craft in maneuvering and hovering as well as landing.
