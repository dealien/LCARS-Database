CLASS: Constellation
TYPE: medium cruiser

Type of Federation spacecraft to which Picard's former command, the Stargazer, belonged. Similar in overall size to the Constitution-class ship, the Constellation-class ships were equipped with four warp nacelles and were thus suited for deep-space exploration and defensive patrol duties.
The prototype was the second starship to bear the name. In 2371 it was sent to bring back the Jem'Hadar teen from Deep Space Nine to Starbase 201. It returned empty handed, as Commander Sisko let the boy escape back home under Odo's care.

Reference: The Battle, The Abandoned 
Named after the Constitution-class vessel commanded by Commodore Matt Decker that sacrificed itself to destroy the planet killer weapon.
The first Constellation-class ship seen, Stargazer, was originally planned to be a Constitution-class ship, allowing the visual effects staff to make use of the existing movie Enterprise model. The producers did not make the decision to build a new model for the Stargazer until after the episode was filmed with LeVar Burton calling it a Constitution-class ship. The choice of the name Constellation was based largely on the fact that it could be dubbed over Geordi's line since the two words are so similar.
