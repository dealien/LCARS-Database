STATIONS: Midas-class

An unmanned communications platform used by the United Federation of Planets. Starfleet Communications used this station to emit a tachyon beam toward a itinerant pulsar which would create a surge powerful enough to create an artificial wormhole. Through that wormhole Starfleet was able to establish instant communication despite the vast distance.
