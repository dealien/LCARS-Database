CLASS: Embea
TYPE: heavy cruiser

The largest starship to be built by the Satarran Rebellion. These became the command ships of the fleet, and were seldom seen by themselves. They were capable of taking out many of the Lysian craft single handedly, but in teams were often used to attack convoys and defend against fleets of Lysian ships.
These craft were just over 250 meters long, 75 meters tall, and 70 meters wide. It was an egg shape ship that grew larger then smaller as an observer looked fore to aft. The bridge was at the top center of the craft with a view of the entire top deck, much like the conning tower aboard a Terran submarine. The lower decks included crew facilities; sickbay, quarters, mess hall, etc. cargo holds, and passenger staterooms. Deck fifteen contained a hangar deck on each side of the craft to allow for transports and other craft to dock internally of the cruiser, and for the transportation of up to ten interceptors. The warp drive units were buried in the hull of the craft with the bussard collectors sticking out the front, and the warp field release at the rear.
Dozens of torpedo launchers, magazines, laser emitters, laser cannon turrets, and other defensive weapons are scattered throughout the ship to offer forward, rear, and side firing defenses.

Reference: Q Neighbor
These ships were modeled after the Republic Cruiser seen in Star Wars: Return of the Jedi that Admiral Ackbar commanded the fleet from.
