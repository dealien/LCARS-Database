SHIPS: Captain Proton’s ship

This holographic representation of a 1930s Earth television program was a favorite activity for Tom Paris and Harry Kim on Voyager’s holodeck. The vessel only had two colors- or shades of gray since the holodeck was programmed to remove color from all items on the deck to more closely resemble the old film series.
