CLASS: Suurok
TYPE: cruiser

A multipurpose craft in use by the Vulcan Central Command. These ships with their radial warp nacelle comprised the majority of the Vulcan’s deep space exploration craft. They also served to assist their allies before the creation of the United Federation of Planets. 

Ships of the line:
Sh’Raan
Ti’Mur

Reference: Breaking the Ice, Silent Enemy
This class has been spelled Surak and Suurok. I accept the latter so that it doesn’t conflict with the other Surak-class runabout.
