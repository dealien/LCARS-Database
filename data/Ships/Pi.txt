SHIPS: Pi, R.S.E.
CLASS: Talon

A Romulan scoutship that crashed on planet Galorndon Core, one-half light year into Federation space, in 2366. The ship was rigged to self destruct shortly after the crash. Only the wreckage of the ship was recovered, and it was believed that the Pi may have been on a covert mission in Federation space.

Reference: The Enemy
The Pi was not seen in "The Enemy" but might assume it would have been the same design as the Romulan scoutship built three episodes later for "The Defector."
