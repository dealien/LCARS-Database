SHIPS: Connecticut
TYPE: Naval

A gunboat in the United States Continental Navy in October, 1776.  The fleet was under the command of General Benedict Arnold, and consisted of three schooners, four galleys, eight fifty-four foot gondalas, and a sloop-of-war (the Enterprise), sixteen ships in all.  On October 11, along with the rest of the fleet, the Connecticut clashed with the British Royal Navy at Valcour Island.  The Continental Navy fought valiantly, but late that evening found themselves in a perilous position.  Unable to fight the British fleet further, the Continental fleet chose to flee under the cover of a heavy fog which flowed into the bay late that evening. Historical accounts show, however, that the British fleet later caught up with the fleeing Continental Navy (trying to reach Fort Ticonderoga) again, forcing another bloody confrontation.  Also, while the Connecticut and similar vessels are referred to as "gunboats" in this story, historical records identify such vessels more precisely as gondala type ships.
