SHUTTLECRAFT: travelpod

A shuttlecraft used to travel between close-range space ports. These can not be used for planetary entry and do not have landing gear. They are most recognizable by the large airlock doors on the aft of the vessel. These ships dock at external mooring points and do not enter landing bays.
Captain Archer and Commander Tucker used one of these to inspect the Enterprise while it was still in drydock after making some test flights. The engineer/pilot accidentally bumped into the starship and scratched the paint.
Admiral Kirk and Scotty rode on of these small shuttles to the Enterprise in 2271, as the ship's transporter wasn't working yet. 
These pods are used for short-term travel, such as back and forth from an orbital office complex to drydock.

The external docking is conjectural but based on the collar-like rear of the craft and lack of an obvious smooth bottom expected for landing.
