SHIPS: Valiant, U.S.S.
Defiant-class
NCC-74210

This destroyer was carrying Red Squad from the Starfleet Academy on a training cruise when it was assigned to collect intelligence on a new Jem'Hadar battleship being designed within Cardassian space. Upon entering that sector the ship was attacked and the crew killed. Red Squad assumed operation of the vessel and decided to continue on course and to collect the data. The Valiant rescued the Jake Sisko and Cadet Nog from a pursuit of Jem'Hadar fighters after them in their runabout. Nog was convinced to help serve as an officer aboard the Valiant, while Jake watched on as a reporter. The Valiant did find the battleship and completed its scans of the warship. But, instead of returning to Federation space with the information, the acting captain, Cadet Tim Watters, decided to attack and disable the battleship before it could do any harm on Starfleet vessels. The battleship was more than a match for the small destroyer and the Valiant was destroyed. Acting first officer, Nog, and Sisko were able to escape in a lifeboat until rescued by Captain Benjamin Sisko.
