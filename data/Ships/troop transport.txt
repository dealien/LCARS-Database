TYPE: troop transport

Transport ships designed to carry a large number of persons and equipped with efficient ways to load and unload the passengers and their equipment. Many of the Alpha & Beta Quadrant races have assault vessels in their fleets that are basically offensive-use troop transports. These can include the Iwo Jima-class, among others.
One of these was sought by Sakonna on her want list of weapons desired for Maquis terrorist use.
