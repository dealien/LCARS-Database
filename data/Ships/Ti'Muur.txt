SHIPS: Ti'Mur
CLASS: Suurok

A Suurok-class, Vulcan ship, the Ti'Mur was commanded by Vanik. The vessel carried encrypted messages for T'Pol, and was sent to watch over the Enterprise NX-01's survey of an eisilium-rich comet. 
The Ti'Mur rescued Reed and Mayweather from the comet. Later, T'Pol used the ship to convey her intention to stay aboard Enterprise rather than enter into an arranged marriage.
