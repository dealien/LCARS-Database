SHIPS: Bounty, H.M.S.
CLASS: B'rel

A Klingon bird-of-prey that was commandeered by the crew of the Enterprise after the Klingons attacked and crippled the Federation starship. Admiral Kirk ordered the self-destruct of the Starfleet vessel and took his crew of six to the scout ship for safety. The ship traveled to Vulcan to return the resurrected Spock to his homeworld to undergo fal-tor-pan. While on the planet is was serviced and repaired so that the Starfleet officers could return to Earth and face court-martial charges. En-route to Earth the crew learned of the debilitating effects caused by the Cetacean probe and attempted a plan to solve the dilema. That plan involved time travel in the utility Klingon ship where they succeeded in bringing forward in time two Humpback whales. The ship crashed landed into the San Francisco Bay when it was also neutralized by the alien probe.
The ship was dubbed the name by Dr. Leonard McCoy after the 18th-century British sailing ship famous for the mutiny of its crew in 1789.
