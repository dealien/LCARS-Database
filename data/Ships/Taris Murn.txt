SHUTTLECRAFT: Taris Murn
CLASS: Toron

Small J'naii interplanetary shuttle whose disappearance with two hands aboard leads to the discovery and charting of the first known null space area. Its plestorene-based life support systems last up to 10 days; significant losses of electromagnetic power drained into null space, barely keeping the crew alive until they could be rescued by one of the Galaxy-class U.S.S. Enterprise's shuttlecraft. 

Reference: The Outcast 
The miniature of the Taris Murn, seen only briefly, was a re-use of the Nenebek model originally built for "Final Mission."
