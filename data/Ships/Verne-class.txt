CLASS: Verne
TYPE: cruiser

A dramatic upgrading of warp drive design, the Verne-class vessels were the most popular of the early warp spaceships. Used for both interplanetary and interstellar missions, the Amity not only made First Contact with Vulcan, but was also the ship that carried the stranded Vulcan survivors back to their home world. 
This ship was named after the novelist Jules Verne that wrote popular books about exploration including "20,000 Leagues Under the Sea."

Reference: Spaceflight Chronology
The Amity starship was labeled as the vessel that made First Contact with Vulcans, by rescuing a damaged Vulcan ship in space and ferrying the passengers back to their world. The significance of the event and its retelling has been diminished to coincide with canon events established in “First Contact.” Now, it is the first Terran vessel to travel to that planet, not the first to meet the race.
