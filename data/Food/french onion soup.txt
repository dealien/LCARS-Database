FOOD: french onion soup

Earth delicacy made from a sauteed roots and meat broth. Often topped with croutons and shredded mozzarella cheese then baked.
A favorite of Captain Benjamin Sisko's - which he wishes he had instead of Chief Miles O'Brien's combat rations during the guerilla holdout against Minister Jaro Essa's coup forces on Deep Space Nine in early 2370.
