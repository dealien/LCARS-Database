FOOD: Antarian Glow Water

When tribble-trading Cyrano Jones offered to sell the exotic and stimulating Antarian Glow Water, everybody thought it was merely another shot of booze. The bartender himself murmured that he used it for polishing precious gems. How wrong they all were. Let me tell you the secret herb that gives the glow to the Antarians. It's the magic ginseng. I give it even more of a punch by adding ginger. To give your evenings a glow of rememberance, here's how you can brew your own version of Antarian Glow Water, to be served as a sparking aperitif or a late-night pick-me-up. This recipe makes 1 8-ounce serving.

1 package powdered ginseng, or 10 to 15 drops ginseng extract
1/8 inch ginger root
8 ounces boiling water
8 ounces sparkling water

Brew the ginseng and ginger in the boiling water as if you were preparing ginger tea. When the ginseng and ginger are fully steeped, about 3 minutes, strain and pour over ice and let sit for 30 minutes. Mix half-and-half with sparking water, and serve over ice. You can make any number of servings of Antarian Glow Water, but be careful; this is potent stuff, and the ginseng alone will give you lots of energy. If you want to drink it hot and strong, don't chill the brew or mix with sparkling water. Simply drink it as you would any herb tea. But drink it gingerly; this stuff's not a soporific.
