FOOD: Picardo Penne

If you like the fresh-cut asparagus, especially the asparagus on the East Coast that makes its appearance with the coming of Spring, you'll love this pasta-veggie recipe.

1 pound penne pasta
1 1/2 to 2 pounds fresh, young asparagus
1 cup pine nuts or shelled walnuts
1/2 red bell pepper, sliced into 1-inch strips
6 to 8 cloves fresh garlic, crushed
1/2 cup virgin olive oil
coarse-ground black pepper (freshly ground is best) to taste
salt to taste
1 dash crushed dried red pepper

While you boil the water for the pasta, cut off the woody stems of the young asparagus you've just washed, and then cut the tender parts of the shoots at an angle into 1-inch pieces so that they look like green versions of the angle-cut penne. Heat the olive oil in a skillet and stir in the crushed garlic. Cook until the garlic just starts to turn transparent. Spoon out a touch of the garlic and olive oil mixture, heat in a nonstick skillet, and add nuts. Slightly toast the nuts. Add the pasta-sized strips of red pepper to the asparagus and garlic, and sauté for about 5 minutes more to soften the peppers and asparagus. Now add the toasted nuts. Brown the mixture, stirring constantly to spread the toasted-nut taste throughout.
When your water is boiling, cook the penne until al dente and drain. Next thoroughly stir in the asparagus, peppers and the toasted-nut garlic oil, and serve with a bright barolo or beaujolais and crusty bread. Serves two to six.
