FOOD: pot roast

A beef dish of 20th century Terran America - researched and served by Neelix to the American "'37s". A 12-kilo roast was burned by an overloaded heating array in Crewman Neelix's kitchen when Lieutenant Thomas Paris filled in, thanks to the infection of a bio-neural gel pack there by the macrovirus in 2373; another had been vaporzied by a power surge in a heating array just before baby Wildman was born a year earlier. 
The roast is often complimented with potatoes and carrots. It is often boiled in a broth with onions, garlic, and parsley.
