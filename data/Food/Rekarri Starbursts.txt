FOOD: Rekarri Starbursts

A colorful drink preferred by Lieutenant Tom Paris to the staid Gallia nectar when he makes changes to Neelix's Paxau Resort holo-program. 

Reference: Warlord
This has a combination of colors, the Gatorade Alpine Snow with thick cherry or grape soda syrup floating on top. If you let the syrup float, especially if you drizzle it around the side of the Alpine Snow, it will gradually settle along the inside of the glass and will look like a star burst. But you can't let these sit. You have to make these drinks one at a time.
