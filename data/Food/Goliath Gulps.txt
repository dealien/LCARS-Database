FOOD: Goliath Gulps

Commercial name for a late-20th-century Earth beverage in an exceedingly large container. 
While the U.S.S. Voyager was stranded in 1996 Los Angeles, Tuvok gathered a "breakfast" of chili burritos, foot-long hot dogs, and Goliath Gulps for himself, Tom Paris and Rain Robinson. Rain commented that this was not a breakfast, but "an afternoon at Dodger Stadium."
