FOOD: Andorian tuber root

A high-calorie delicacy of the blue-skinned UFP member race. Dax enjoys it so much she once picked it out of Sisko's leftovers after a dinner at Quark's . 
Neelix- "Andorian potatoes are another of Jadzia's favorites. You can bake 'em, you can boil 'em, but I like 'em in a pie. My version for your kitchens is a baked sweet potato pie with an optional topping of marshmallows.

2 large sweet potatoes
1/8 cup (1/4 stick) butter, melted
1/2 cup whole milk (you can use half-and-half)
1/4 cup light brown sugar
1 tablespoon plain or vanilla yogurt
1/2 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 pinch nutmeg
16 ounces marshmallows (optional)
1 packaged pie crust

Wash and pierce sweet potatoes, then microwave on high for 20 minutes while you preheat your oven to 350 degrees. When potatoes are cooked, mash them in a mixing bowl. While they are steaming hot add the melted butter and stir thoroughly. Next add the sugar, vanilla, milk, and yogurt. Finally add the nutmeg. Line a pan tin with the crust and spoon in the sweet potato pie filling. Bake for 30 minutes. If you want to top with a nice marshmallow crust, cut marshmallows in half and arrange them over the top of the pie. Bake for an additional 15 minutes, and serve. I'm told that Jadzia liked this dish much more than Sisko did, even though a baked sweet potato pie is exactly what Joe Sisko served at his restaurant. Serves six to eight.
