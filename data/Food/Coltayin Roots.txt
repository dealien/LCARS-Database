FOOD: Coltayin Roots with Terrellian Spices

When the image of Anna prepared coltayin roots for the marooned Captain Picard, she mixed tuber-like vegetation with Terellian spices. Here in the Delta Quadrant, we don't have Terellian spices, much less coltayin roots, so I have to make do. The original virute of coltayin roots was their nutritional value. These things could feed an army of Jem'Hadar, if those guys ate anything other than their "white." The closest equivalent to coltayin roots on Earth are yams, which can also feed a small army. I'd bake or roast them, and you can do it in your microwave oven, using allspice or a very mild chutney to replace the Terellian spices.
the yams should be boiled with their skins on for about 30 minutes, split, and tested for doneness. Boiled yams can simply be mashed with a teaspoon of butter and 1/2 teaspoon allspice and served, or they can be split, buttered, lightly mashed with a fork in their skins with allspice, and baked for 30 minutes at 375 degrees for a twice-cooked yam.
To bake, preheat the oven to 375 degrees, pierce the skins with a fork, and bake for about 1 hour. You can also bake medium-sized yams in your microwave on high, skins punctured, for 15 minutes. After microwaving, allow to cool for about 1 minute, test for doneness with a fork, and microwave for additional increments of 5 minutes until done. Serve split open, buttered, with allspice.
Yams can also be served with a variety of sweet or spicy chutneys according to taste. You can make your chutney, of course, or you can go to the gourmet food section of your supermarket, where you'll find a variety of chutneys.
