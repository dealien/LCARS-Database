FOOD: steak

A popular cut of meat from a Terran cow bred for slaughter. Various types of steaks are available depending on which section of the animal is served, like T-bone, Filet Mignon, Porterhouse, Prime Rib, Rib Eye, and others.
When barbecued, the T-bone cut was part of Lieutenant Tom Paris' second imaginary seven-course meal while in Akritirian prison.
