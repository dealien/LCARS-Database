FOOD: chocolate

Made from roasted and ground cacao seeds, this popular Earth confection has a rich and varied history. There are various varieties including dark chocolate, and milk chocolate.
The Terran sweet was perhaps a commodity on DS9 during the Bajor Occupation ; Quark offered some to Odo to make up for their "rough start" back in 2363. It was defintiely a favorite of Counselor Deanna Troi in all its forms.
