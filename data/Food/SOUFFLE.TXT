FOOD: souffle

A baked Earth dish made with eggs and served as either an entree or dessert. The eggs make the dish fluffy and porous.
On the occasion of the Bajor-Cardassian peace treaty signing in 2371, and noting its namesake's new popularity, Quark named a new souffle served at the ceremonies on DS9 as the "Kai Winn." Earlier, Odo helped Sisko whip up a souffle as part of his Creole banquet for the senior staff.
