FOOD: beets

Sisko's dish of sauteed beets is welcomed by all the senior staff - except Bashir. 
Neelix- "Commander Sisko liked his jambalaya in a sauce made from sauteed salt back or even bacon, flavored with a pat of butter. To this you add thin sliced beets and saute in a very shallow pan until they're done. You can also shred the beets or cube them, according to your own taste. I don't like the animal fat myself and prefer to use a lot of butter and salt and keep stirring the beets until they start turning brown on the edges.
