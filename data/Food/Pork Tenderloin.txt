FOOD: Pork Tenderloin

5 pounds pork tenderloin
6 cloves garlic
1 cup seasoned flour
4 ounces English orange marmalade
1/2 cup Cointreau or sherry
salt, pepper, paprika, oregano to taste

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Rub the pork all over with a crushed garlic clove, then slice the remaining cloves into slivers. Preseason the flour with salt, pepper, paprika, oregano, and dredge the meat lightly in the flour. Then stud the tenderloins all over with the garlic slivers by inserting them into the flesh. Place on a rack in a roasting pan on the middle shelf of the oven, and roast at 350 degrees for 1 hour.
While roasting, combine the marmalade and liquor in a bowl and mix. After 1 hour, baste the tenderloin completely with this glaze mixture, and cook at 400 degrees until the glaze assumes a light crustiness, about 20 minutes. pork is ready when only slightly pink in the center. Serves for to six.
Serve with Italian roasted potatoes: peel 2 pounds potatoes and cut into thirds; place in a separate roasting pan with 1 cup olive oil, 1 melted stick of butter, 8 whole garlic cloves, and salt and pepper to taste. Toss thoroughly and cook for 40 minutes at 350 degrees.
I serve this with 2 pounds fresh wilted spinach on the side- drizzled with lemon juice and olive oil, and a whole head of garlic, minced- and a nice crusty French bread and a bottle of pinot noir. Obviously, this is not a dish I can enjoy in my ready room on Voyager because, as Tom Paris will tell you, there's no pinot noir.

Reference:
I [Kate Mulgrew] cook for a crew of hungry boys at home, so I ask my butcher for his best tenderloin cut. When the family's all served, I take care of myself in my own ready room.
