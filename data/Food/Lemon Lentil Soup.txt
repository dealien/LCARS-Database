FOOD: Lemon Lentil Soup

The trick is to learn how to eat in such a way that your karma goes up while your hunger goes down. One way is to eat only veggies, so that nothing dies because of you. Here's a Middle Eastern soup I make that is guaranteed to give you a karma boost with every spoonful.

1 cup lentils
6 cups water
1 medium white potato, peeled and cut into small cubes
1 cup chopped celery
1 cup chopped Swiss chard
3 tablespoons olive oil
1/4 cup chopped parsley
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1/2 teaspoon cumin powder or 1 pinch whole cumin seeds
1/2 cup lemon juice
kosher or sea salt to taste

After rinsing the lentils, bring the 6 cups of water to a boil in a large pot. Add the rinsed lentils and cook for 45 minutes or until they're very tender. In a skillet, fry the potatoes in the olive oil, sprinkled with the pepper, for 10 minutes; then add celery and fry for another minute or two. Add this to the lentils and cook for 15 minutes. Next add the Swiss chard, parsley, and cumin, and cook for another 15 minutes. Next add the lemon juice and salt to taste, and then serve. Serves four to six.
