An Argrathi fruit. In his virtual-world imprisonment, cellmate Ee'char squeezed some of its juice out for O'Brien when he was first jailed. The fruit is not known to Federation or Cardassian replicator menus. 
Neelix of Voyager made a dessert based on his analysis of the fruit. Neelix- "It's kind of a staple made from sliced green apples in their own juices. You can make it as a dessert, not unlike apple compote, but without the brandy that compotes sometimes have."
2 - 3 pounds green apples (Granny Smith recommended)
3 cups ice-cold water
1 cup white grape juice
1 1/2 cups sugar
1 teaspoon lemon or lime juice
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon cinnamon
Wash and core the apples and slice them into a large saucepan, leaving them in their own juice. Add the rest of the ingredients and bring to a boil. Simmer for about 1 hour until the apples become tender. Refrigerate for about 2 hours. Serve cold. You can add whipped cream or heavy cream, or serve over a pound cake, or if you're an ice cream fan, drop a scoop of vanilla ice cream into the apple compote or serve the compote as a topping over ice cream and pound cake. Serves 2 to 4.
