FOOD: Endive Salad

The commander [of Deep Space 9] has a passion for endive, probably because like his other favorites, it is used a lot in Creole and Cajun cooking. Endive can be used in a lettuce, leak, hearts of palm, and fennel salad. Simply wash all of the ingredients and drain. Chop, toss in a salad bowl, and serve with balsamic vinegar or vinaigrette dressing. A snappy endive salad is particularly good compliment to sauteed beets, with or without jambalaya, or it's even good all by itself for lunch. It's also great for a late snack with you can't sleep but don't want to go to bed after a whole meal. Endive is also quite healthy.
