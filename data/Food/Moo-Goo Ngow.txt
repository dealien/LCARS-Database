FOOD: Moo-Goo Ngow

Another recipe I prepare for Harry Kim is Moo-Goo Ngow, my variation of a traditional Asian dish.

1 minced garlic clove
3 tablespoons cooking oil
1 1/2 pounds round steak, cut into small pieces
3 tablespoons chopped onion
1 1/2 cups beef bouillon
1/2 pound mushrooms
5 tablespoons cornstarch
1 tablespoon soy sauce
2 teaspoons water

Heat the oil in a large frying pan or, better, a wok or electric wok, until it's hot; then add garlic. Reduce heat and sauté about 2 minutes. Remove garlic. Add the steak and onion and sauté over an easy flame, stirring constantly until the meat is brown. Add the broth and mushrooms, and cook gently for 10 minutes. Make a thin paste by combining the soy sauce, water, and cornstarch; let it thicken for about a minute, then pour it over the stir-fried meat and mix it in. Keep stirring until the liquid thickens up. Serve meat and sauce over rice. Serves 4.
