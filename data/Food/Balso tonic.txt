FOOD: Balso tonic

A drink, possibly of Trill origin; the Riker/Odan temporary host entity tried to order one from his guest cabin replicator in 2367. The Enterprise's computer didn't have the formula on file and requested the molecular structure. 
Neelix- "Here's a quick drink that Trill hosts seem to like. Ambassador Odan had a hankering for balso tonic on the Enterprise-D, but the ship's replicators couldn't make it. Beverly Crusher, who fell in love with the ambassador before she realized he was a joined Trill, tried to find a way to make the drink. I, myself, have played around with a recipe for it, and here's what I came up with. If we ever get back to the Alpha Quadrant and I get a chance to pay a visit to Deep Space 9, I'll deliver it personally to Jadzia Dax to see whether it tickles her Trill fancy.

8 stalks celery
1 piece fresh ginger
16 ounces sparkling water or Perrier water
1 teaspoon celery seed
1 teaspoon honey, or more to taste

In your juicer extract the celery and ginger juices into a glass. Add the celery seed. Combine with sparkling water or Perrier and add honey to taste. Serve over ice if that's your pleasure, too. Yields approximately two or three servings.
