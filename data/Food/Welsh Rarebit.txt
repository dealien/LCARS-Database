FOOD: Welsh Rarebit

After I learned that Janeway's grandfather prepared this dish for the captain when she was a child and that she loved it, I studied how to prepare it. Thousands of light-years away from Earth in the Delta Quadrant, this is a dish that reminds her of home, so I learned all I could about it. I also learned that it was "rarebit," not "rabbit," and that it was really a glorified cheese casserole.
Everybody will tell you to make this dish. You can make it according to the Anglo-Saxon method with beer or ale. You can also make it with heavy (double) cream, light cream, or whole milk. You can also make it with a reduced fat milk, but it's not going to be as tasty. You can also substitute your handy microwave over or stovetop saucepan for the requisite double boiler that everybody says you have to use when you're melting cheese.

1/8 cup (1/4 stick) butter
2 cups coarsely grated sharp cheddar cheese
1 tablespoon Dijon or hot Polish mustard
1/4 tablespoon paprika or cayenne pepper
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1 egg yolk, carefully separated from the white and slightly stirred
1/2 cup light cream or 1/4 cup whole milk and 1/4 cup light cream
salt to taste

In a microwave oven ot on the stovetop in a saucepan or double boiler, melt the butter carefully and add the cheese. Stir as the butter and cheese melt into a fine sauce, and then add the mustard, paprika or cayenne, Worcestershire sauce, and salt to taste. Stir to blend and add the cream or milk-and-cream combination and stir until the mixture is hot and smooth. Finally, remove from heat or microwave and stir in the eggg yolk until it is completely blended. You can serve this over toast points, which is how Captain Janeway likes it, or a crusty bread. Makes four to six servings.
