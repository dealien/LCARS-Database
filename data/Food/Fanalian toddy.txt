FOOD: Fanalian toddy

Drink ordered very hot at Quark's by Dr. Bashir and Leeta for their cough. 

Reference: Explorers 
Actually a cough remedy, according to Dr. Bashir, which he once ordered from Quark's. This drink is hot, of course, and has a clear color, almost beige, kind of like a schnapps. It's not thin and watery, but has almost the consistency of syrup. There are at least three ways to make this by the mug. One is to use just a touch of light molasses or light Karo corn syrup with a clear Gatorade lemon-lime. There are two versions of this drink in the supermarket. You can get a dark green lemon-lime and a clear, much lighter lemon-lime. I would use the second, clear lemon-lime, thicken it with just a little Karo syrup, and heat it. Then I'd float cinnamon on the surface of the mug.
Another way is to heat lemon Jell-O but to cut it with lots of water so that it never thickens and serve it hot. Now it's a beige drink that will stay liquefied as long as you keep it warm.
Finally, you can mix lemon Kool-Aid with Knox unflavored gelatin, keeping the gelatin consistency very thin and, again, serve it nice and warm with cinnamon or a touch of brown sugar on top of it in the mug. When you use gelatin mixes to thicken your drinks, make sure you use extra water and cut it by at least two-thirds to make sure you don't wind up with a glass of gelatin at the end of the day when the mixture reaches room temperature. If you need to reheat the mugs, microwave them for about thirty seconds, making sure the surface of the mug has cooled before serving it to anybody, so it is safe to handle.
