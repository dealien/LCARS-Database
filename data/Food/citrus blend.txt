FOOD: citrus blend

A citrus drink available from Deep Space Nine replicators is a "decent" recipe, especially for mornings. Arjin turned down Lieutenant Jadzia Dax's query about getting one. This can also be served with the fruits as a fruit cocktail.
Neelix says the trick to preparing this is to let the fruit flavors blend in your refrigerator for a few hours- even overnight- before you serve. You can sweeten this with some sugar, or you can add a dash of vanilla extract and some lemon juice and let the fruits speak for themselves.

1/2 pint strawberries, sliced
1/2 pint raspberries
2 tablespoons water
1/2 cup sliced peaches
1/2 cup sliced kiwi
any other favorite fruits, including blueberries, blackberries, cantaloupe, honeydew, watermelon, moba fruit, icoberries, uttaberries, and others
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup sugar (optional)
1/2 teaspoon lemon juice

First, wash berries thoroughly in water as cold as you can stand, thinly slicing them under running water and dropping slices into a very large punch bowl. After slicing, add 2 tablespoons of water, do not drain. Add peaches, kiwi, and melon along with vanilla, sugar, and lemon juice. Stir and let them sit in the liquid for at least 4 hours in the refrigerator before serving. Serves four to five.
