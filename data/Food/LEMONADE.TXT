FOOD: lemonade

An age-old Earth citrus juice drink made with lemons, water and sugar. 
An apparent favorite of Commander William Riker's; his memory of it stirred Q to create it when the entity produced drinks on an unidentified planet during his second visit to the U.S.S. Enterprise-D. As revealed in his orb vision, Commander Benjamin Sisko was carrying a tray of three glasses of lemonade when he met wife-to-be Jennifer at Gilgo Beach. Jake Sisko has also ordered lemonade in his quarters.
