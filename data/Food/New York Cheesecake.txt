FOOD: Cheesecake

An Earth desert involving baked cheese in a pie form. These side dishes are often complimented with fresh fruit and fruit syrup, chocolate, or other toppings. In rare cases the toppings are swirled into the batter before baking. Cheesecakes became so popular that "no-bake" varieties were also common in grocery stores for simple creation at home.
The holographic EMH aboard the U.S.S. Voyager sampled, among other things, New York Cheesecake for the first time while temporarily inhabiting Seven of Nine's Borg implants in an effort to hide from a species hostile to photonic beings.
