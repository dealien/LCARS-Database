FOOD: coffee

A popular drink in many cultures that is usually high in caffeine and made from boiling ground, roasted beans in water. It is valued for its caffeinated lift. It is often consumed in the morning.  
It was a beverage often served on Captain James Kirk's original Enterprise bridge and programmed into its food units. 
On the U.S.S. Enterprise-D, Chief Miles O'Brien begged off having coffee with Gillespie in Ten-Forward, saying he's drunk too much lately. Wesley Crusher at first only asked Ensign Robin Lefler for a "coffee date" in Ten-Forward, but she upped the invitation to dinner. 
Captain Benjamin Sisko's favorite beverage was hard to come by when the replicators and Deep Space Nine in general seemed to be breaking down all at once to keep Chief Miles O'Brien busy. Captain Kasidy Yates' first date with Sisko was over coffee. The chief drinks his black, doublesweet; Sisko drinks his black. Keiko O'Brien knows Mikes never drinks coffee after noon, so she realized the T'Lani security tape with a morning time index was faked. Major Kira Nerys likes it, and a tad on the hot side too. Captain Kathryn Janeway would rather use a replicator ration for coffee than try a Neelix substitute, but she gives in to it as an example; her hunger for coffee sent the ship into a living nebula by mistake. 
The Klingon variety is known as raktajino.
Crewman Neelix created a special blend of coffee to commemroate the historic flight made by Lieutenant Tom Paris, where he broke the warp 10 threshold. The honoree didn't care much for it, and it sparked the first allergic reaction during Paris' hyper-evolution.
