FOOD: Chicken and Sun-Dried Tomatoes

1 16-ounce package spinach or multicolored rotelle pasta (largest size)
2 to 3 boneless chicken breats (skinless is optional)
16 ounces pesto sauce (packaged, from the refrigerator section of supermarket)
6-ounce jar sun-dried tomatoes in olive oil
2 tablespoons virgin olive oil
2 tablespoons garlic powder or 3 cloves garlic, crushed
salt and pepper to taste
grated Romano cheese, if desired

While pasta is cooking in boiling water, slice chicken breats into long bite-sized pieces. Coat the cooking surface of a 12-inch skillet with olive oil, add garlic powder ot crushed garlic cloves, and heat. When pasta is done, drain and set aside. Cook sliced chicken in the olive oil and garlic over medium heat, turning frequently until chicken pieces just turn brown. Do not burn. Drain sun-dried tomatoes and slice into thin lengthwise pieces. Combine pasta, cooked chicken, sun-dried tomatoes, and pesto sauce in a large mixing bowl or salad bowl. Toss thoroughly, cover lightly, and place in refrigerator. Serve well chilled. You may add some more olive oil and Romano cheese. This dish goes very well with a pinot grigio or Soave.

Reference:
My character, Ensign Kim, loves twentieth-century Earth cuisine. It's fortunate for me that I like it too. This is one of my favorite recipes because it combines my favorite spinach rotelle with sun-dried tomatoes (I like the imported kind for a treat every once in a blue moon) and fresh chicken breasts. This is a light dish that also makes a great luncheon entree on a buffet table.
