PERSONNEL: Danny Byrd
Ensign, engineering officer, Starfleet Research & Design

Ensign Harry Kim's best friend back home, who attended Starfleet Academy with him. In an alternate reality created in 2372 when Kim's shuttle intersected a timestream, Ensign Byrd had gotten the position of operations officer on the U.S.S. Voyager, rather than Kim, and therefore it was Byrd who was lost with Voyager in the Badlands and declared dead, while Kim remained on Earth with his girlfriend. 

Reference: Non Sequitur
It is assumed that the two switched places while the exactness of Byrd's position was never established. The fact that Kim returned to his apartment and girlfriend indicates that it is not a total switch so it is conjectural.
