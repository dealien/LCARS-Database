PERSONNEL: Alan Burke
Yeoman, U.S.S. Enterprise-A

Crewman aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise-A in 2293 during the mission where Captain Kirk was to escort Chancellor Gorkon and his Klingon delegation to Earth for peace talks. Burke was part of the conspiracy to assassinate Gorkon to prevent those peace initiatives from taking place. When the ship carrying Gorkon, Kronos One, was disabled, Yeoman Burke and Yeoman Samno surreptitiously beamed over wearing environmental suits and gravity boots, and killed several Klingons including the Chancellor. The beamed back and hid their bloodstained suits in a compartment in the Enterprise mess hall, where they were later discovered by Engineer Scott. Since the first rule of assassination is to kill the assassins (according to Kirk), Burke and Samno were shot at close range by a phaser set on stun (because a stronger setting would have set off an alarm), and left for dead in an Enterprise corridor. When the senior crew discovered their bodies, they flushed out the killer by announcing shipwide that Burke and Samno were in Sickbay, and that they were to give a statement to a court recorder. It was Lt. Valeris who entered Sickbay to presumably finish the job she started, and she was exposed as one of the conspirators.
