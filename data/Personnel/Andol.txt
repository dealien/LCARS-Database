PERSONNEL: Andol
Lieutenant, tactician, Starbase 375

An intelligent and creative officer hired to develop military battle plans for defensive and offensive moves. During the Dominion war he was transferred to Starbase 375 to assist Admiral Ross in planning moves for the allied forces; Starfleet, Klingon, and Romulan, fleets. He and Lieutenant Sams, another tactical officer working as his partner, developed the Front Line battle strategy. That strategy called for the offensive by the allied forces to take over a total of twelve Nor-class stations built by the Cardassians and mostly empty, then upgrade the station's systems and begin operations in each as defensive outposts against the axis forces; Dominion, Cardassian, and Breen fleets. Even though not all stations were claimed, the plan was largely successful.
