PERSONNEL: Mila

Cardassian woman employed by Enabran Tain for over three decades as his housekeeper. She believed in Garak's loyalty. In 2371 Tain was considering having her killed because she knew too much. She continued to reside in the house after the death of Tain and was helpful to the Cardassian resistance movement that overthrew the Dominion. During an investigation by Jem'Hadar soldiers of the house, she was found to be harboring rebels in the basement of the house (Major Kira Nerys, Gul Dumar, and Elim Garak) and was killed.
