PERSONNEL: Sirella
Lady, Speaker of the House, Qo'noS

General Martok's wife, daughter of Linkasa, 23rd maternal granddaughter of Princess Shenara. Sirella came to Deep Space Nine to perform the Bre'Nan ritual before Jadzia Dax could wed Worf and join the House of Martok. After much coaching and aggravation Jadzia Dax researched Klingon history and discovered that Sirella was not truly descendant from royalty, but from the concubine that assumed a royal position. She used the shameful revelation as leverage to get Sirella to back off.
