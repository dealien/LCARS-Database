PERSONNEL: Javert
Inspector, France, Earth

French police inspector who ruthlessly pursued Valjean in the human novel Les Miserables written by Victor Hugo in 1862. Valjean was guilty of a petty crime but Javert pursued him relentlessly. In the end Javert's own inflexibility destroyed him, and he committed suicide. 
Michael Eddington likened himself to the heroic Valjean, and saw his nemesis Captain Benjamin Sisko as the flawed, implacable Javert.
