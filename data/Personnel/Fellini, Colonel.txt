PERSONNEL: Ed Fellini
Colonel, station commander, Omaha Air Base - Earth

United States Air Force officer who interrogated Captain James Kirk, and Lieutenant Hikaru Sulu when they were arrested at the Omaha base in 1969. The duo was on a covert mission to eliminate records of the Enterprise's accidental presence in Earth's past to avoid the possible contamination of history. Fellini became frustrated with Kirk (who could not answer any questions for fear of causing further contamination), and threatened to lock the captain up for 200 years. Kirk thought that was just about right.
