PERSONNEL: Jack Hayes
Admiral, Starfleet Command

Senior Starfleet officer who on stardate 50893 (2373) mobilized a fleet of starships in the Typhon sector to meet a Borg ship that had entered Federation space on a heading for Earth. Admiral Hayes ordered the Enterprise-E away from the battle. The Admiral's flagship was destroyed when the armada battled the Borg vessel, but Hayes survived. 
Around Stardate 51501 (2374), Hayes sent an encrypted message to the U.S.S. Voyager in the Delta Quadrant by way of a Hirogen relay station. In the message he expressed Starfleet's regrets at not being able to help the lost ship return home, and included data that Starfleet had collected about the Delta Quadrant, as well as several personal letters to the Voyager crew from relatives and friends.
