Ferengi commander of a D'Kora-class transport vessel, Prak was stranded in the Hekaras Corridor in 2370. Although Prak's initial assumption was that he was disabled by Federation technology, the Ferengi was eventually given assitance to fix his ship by Captain Picard's crew. This resulted in the Ferengi sharing his sensor log information to help in the investigation for the missing Federation ship the U.S.S. Fleming.
