PERSONNEL: Batai
musician, Ressik, Kataan

Native of the Ressik community on planet Kataan, son of the ironweaver Kamin, who lived in the 14th century (Earth calendar) prior to their sun going nova. Young Batai was named after Kamin's friend, a leader on the Ressik council. Memories of him were preserved aboard a space probe launched from Kataan, and experienced by Jean-Luc Picard a thousand years later. While in school, Young Batai showed an interest in many fields - mathematics, botany, sculpture - but his real passion was playing the flute. He even left school to concentrate on his music.
