PERSONNEL: Felix

Friend of Julian Bashir who created the Vic Fontaine holosuite program which proved to be very popular at Deep Space 9. Felix designed Fontaine to be self-aware as a hologram, believing it would give the character an attitude appropriate for the 1960's era he represented. Felix also inserted a "jack-in-the-box" in Vic's program - a deeply buried surprise algorithm to keep things interesting - in the form of Frankie Eyes, a mobster character who threatened Vic's life and livelihood. The jack-in-the-box would not allow deletion of characters, and resetting the program would eliminate all of Vic's memories, so users were forced to help Vic defeat Frankie Eyes in a way that was period-specific.
