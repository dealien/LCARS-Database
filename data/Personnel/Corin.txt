PERSONNEL: Corin

A Drayan male. In 2372, Tuvok encountered Corin on a moon where his shuttle crash-landed. Corin appeared to be a young child, but was actually nearing the end of his natural life, because Drayans age in reverse. Corin and several other elder Drayans traveled to one of the Drayan moons in order to carry out their final ritual. Their shuttle crashed on the moon and all of their Attendants died, leaving the elders alone. Tuvok, believing them to be children, comforted and cared for them. Corin died of natural causes in the sacred location.
