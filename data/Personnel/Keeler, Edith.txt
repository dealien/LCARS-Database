PERSONNEL: Edith Keeler
Social worker, Earth

Human social worker who lived during the first part of the 20th century, dying in a street accident in the year 1930. Centuries later, during a survey of the Guardian of Forever by the U.S.S. Enterprise, the ship's Chief Medical Officer Dr. Leonard McCoy, during a temporary bout of mental illness brought on by an accidental injection of cordrazine, escaped into Earth's past. While there, he saved Keeler from dying, which sparked a chain of events throughout the timeline, essentially changing history. 
In the altered timeline Keeler, a passionate believer in peace, spearheaded a movement which delayed the entry of the United States into World War II, paving the way for an Axis victory. Ultimately Starfleet, the Federation and the U.S.S. Enterprise were no longer in existence, but the proximity to the Guardian of Forever by the landing party allowed Enterprise Captain James T. Kirk and First Officer Spock to follow McCoy into the past. 
Kirk and Spock were able to prevent McCoy from saving Keeler's life, reinstating the timeline. These events were particularly trying for Kirk, as he had fallen in love with Keeler.
