PERSONNEL: Rionoj
Captain, Boslic freighter

Ship's officer who delivered Li Nalas' earing to Quark on station Deep Space Nine. She received it from a maintenance worker on Cardassia IV, who asked her to deliver it to Bajor. On stardate 48214, she sold Quark wreckage of a ship that had crash landed in the Gamma Quadrant. Within the wreckage was a Jem'Hadar baby. In late 2372 Odo suspected Rionoj of trafficking in stolen Falangian diamonds.

Reference: The Homecoming, The Abandoned, Broken Link
Portrayed by Leslie Bevis. The name was not mentioned in the episode, but referred to as Boslic freighter captain as in early scripts. The script for "Broken Link" mentioned her name but it was not said. The Continuum should be ashamed of the minimal reference they made for this character- it is almost as bad as their other mistakes.
