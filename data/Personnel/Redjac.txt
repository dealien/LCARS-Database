PERSONNEL: Redjac

Noncorporeal lifeform that has existed for centuries by journeying from planet to planet and feeding off fear. Hengist was the last known incarnation of Redjac, before being dispersed into space. 
The entity is thought to be responsible for several murders in London, England, Earth and known as Jack the Ripper; on Deneb II as Kesla, and on Rigel IV as Beratis. It also took over Mr. Hengist to travel to Argelius II and murdered three more people. Investigations are still underway to see if a connection exists to five murders in Kiev, U.S.S.R, Earth in 1974, and eight murders in the Martian Colonies in 2105, ten murders on planet Alpha Eridani II in 2156.
