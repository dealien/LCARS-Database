PERSONNEL: D'Sogat
Member of the High Council, Qo'noS

Leader of the House of D'Sogat, and affiliated with the House of Duras. During the Klingon Civil War his House stood with the other against Gowron. He had many other issues in which he argued with Gowron over that nearly cost him his position many time. But D'Sogat was previously an advocate himself and well trained in the legal precedants of their culture which he reminded Gowron of in order to maintain his position. On many occasions Gowron tried to dispel the opposition and D'Sogat would point out that the actions were still honorable, and his objection to a person in support of an unfavorable proposal was not being acting dishonorably. 
D'Sogat was respected by Martok, the newer Chancellor. The two of them did not have the disagreements that Gowron and D'Sogat had. And while D'Sogat often agreed with TuQ'leth and not with Martok, Martok took more offense to TuQ'leth.
This was an interesting point Dargo learned when he sought help from the High Council in his dispute against Worf. D'Sogat was unwilling to help Dargo since it might upset his balance with Martok. But he anonymously informed Dargo of TuQ'leth's open displeasure with the Chancellor and knew that the Councilor would be of better help. D'Sogat was more surprising when he took up the call and continued to advocate to Dargo after the death of TuQ'leth. By then, however, support for Dargo's case had been earned by many other Councilors and D'Sogat was not sticking his neck out for Dargo.
