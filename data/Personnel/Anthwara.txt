PERSONNEL: Anthwara
Councillor, planetary leader, Dorvan V

Leader of the tribal council of the Native American colonists on planet Dorvan V. Anthwara's grandfather, Katowa, had led this band from Earth in the 2170s in search of a new home among the stars. The group wandered the stars for nearly two centuries, searching for a suitable home, until Anthware led his group to Dorvan V in 2350. When he arrived, the mountains, the rivers, and the sky welcoed him. He refused to be moved from what he knew was his sacred land, despite pressure from the Federation government in 2370. Anthwara was able to convince both the Federation and the Cardassian Union that his people should be allowed to remain on Dorvan V under Cardassian jurisdiction.
