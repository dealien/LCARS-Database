PERSONNEL: Mark Jameson
Admiral, diplomatic officer, U.S.S. Gettysburg

Lauded Starfleet officer who had commanded the U.S.S. Gettysburg during his youth, yet ruined his career and his legacy when it was revealed he had traded weapons for hostages years earlier on Mordan IV. Jameson had been suffering from Iverson's Disease and sought to return to his youth through a rejuvenation treatment on Cerebus II, which reversed the aging process. The process is not normally shared with outsiders but Jameson served as a mediator during a dispute the planet had and the government felt indebted to him. They offered him two treatments, one for him and one for his wife. He took both doses and died of side-effects from the rejuvenation treatment.
