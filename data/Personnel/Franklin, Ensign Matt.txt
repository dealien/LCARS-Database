PERSONNEL: Matt Franklin
Ensign, engineering officer, U.S.S. Jenolen

Engineer aboard the U.S.S. Jenolen at the time it crashed into a Dyson Sphere in 2294. He and Montgomery Scott survived the crash and attempted to keep themselves alive until a rescue ship arrived by suspending themselves in a transporter pattern buffer. The attempt was partially successful - Scott survived for 75 years, but Franklin died when his pattern degraded beyond recovery.
