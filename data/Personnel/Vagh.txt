PERSONNEL: Vagh
Governor, Kriosian System

In 2367, the Kriosians rebelled when they were aided and prompted by the Romulans. Vagh, however, believed the crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise were inciting unrest. He was almost assassinated by Geordi La Forge under Romulan control as part of a plan to separate the Klingon and Federation alliance.
