A young Talaxian boy who lived with his mother and a group of refugees that fled Talaxia when the Haakonians attacked the moon Rinax. Brax lost his father during those attacks. The refugees created a colony thousands of light years from their homeworld and were discovered by the U.S.S. Voyager as the starship attempted to return to Federation space. Neelix, a Talaxian crewman on the Federation starship befriended the boy and his mother and eventually decided to transfer to the colony and not continue the voyage on the vessel.
