PERSONNEL: Calvin Hudson
Commander, sector liaison, Demilitarized Zone

A former Starfleet officer, Hudson later became a leader of the outlaw Maquis movement. While serving in Starfleet as an attache to the Federation colonies along the Federation-Cardassian Demilitarized Zone, Hudson was actually leading a double life. 
Hudson was a classmate and close friend of Benjamin Sisko. Both held high goals for their careers in the service, expecting to be captains by age 30, and admirals by age 40. Both were present at the other's wedding and maintained contact throughout the years. Hudson married a woman named Gretchen.
Using his Starfleet position he was able acquire intelligence and supplies for the Maquis. It led to an attack on the Bok'Nor, a freighter that docked with Deep Space 9 and was suspected of transporting supplies to Cardassian terrorists within the DMZ. Hudson's duplicity was uncovered by Sisko, who was commanding Deep Space 9. 
Admiral Alynna Nechayev held meetings with the two men aboard the station shortly before Hudson's revelation in an attempt to identify the growing terrorist threat of the Maquis. After his obvious resignation, she ordered that he was a wanted man by Starfleet. Although Hudson escaped capture by Starfleet it has since been reported that he is deceased, killed by Jem'Hadar soldiers when they moved into the DMZ to extinguish any threats to the new Dominion borders.
