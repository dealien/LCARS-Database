PERSONNEL: Nick Hoojier
Fleet Admiral, communications officer, Starfleet Intelligence

This senior specialist is also known by the codename "St@rf0x" back when he did covert work for the bureau. Now he is the chief person assigned to declaring information as classified and unclassified, and maintaining the equipment providing communication through the entire United Federation of Planets. He is responsible for approving new technologies, sub-routines, and security proceedures used to protect and enhance the Forums and subspace communications channels that are used by Starfleet personnel. Civilian traffic is often enhanced but not directly under his authority.
