PERSONNEL: Armus

A malevolent life-form on planet Vagra II. Armus was formed when the inhabitants of Vagra II developed a means of ridding themselves of all that was evil within themselves. The Vagrans all departed from their homes as creatures of dazzling beauty, leaving behind Armus, whose malevolence was compunded by the loneliness of having been abandoned. Armus resembled an oil slick, but was capable of forming himslef into a humanoid shape, and could also generate force fields of considerable strength. Armus killed U.S.S. Enterprise-D security chief Lieutenant Natasha Yar when she was participating in a rescue mission on Vagra II. Armus had no apparent motive for the murder, except for his own amusement. Armus is believed to still exist on Vagra II.
