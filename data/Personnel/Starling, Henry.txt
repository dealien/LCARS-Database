PERSONNEL: Henry Starling

In an alternate timeline, Henry Starling captured a damaged 29th-century timeship in 1967 and used its contents to assist in the development of Earth's computer revolution. To that end he founded Chronowerx Corporation, based in Los Angeles. In 1996 Starling attempted to take the timeship back into the future, but died when the ship was destroyed by the U.S.S. Voyager.
