PERSONNEL: Jede Tulan
Cadet 2nd class, engineering division, Starfleet Academy

A joined Trill cadet taking courses through the Starfleet Academy.
Jede Wetan was born November 25, 2351 in Makaba, Trill to Yora Wetan. He was raised in traditional Trill fashion with a heavy emphasis on symbiont education in preparation for he being accepted into the Initiate Training Program. At age 7 he was accepted and began taking additional courses to help prepare him for his possible joining with a symbiont some day.
While at the Symbiosis center he met many of the most famous joined pairs in the planet's history; including Curzon Dax, and Feral Odan. Both of those persons worked for the Federation in diplomatic ways and spoke very highly of it and the Starfleet. Discussions with those two helped focus Jede on a goal for his life after the Commission made a decision, for or against his joining. Once he found a new focal point to work on he accelerated quicker through the conditioning stages the Commission established for initiates.
