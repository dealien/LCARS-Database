PERSONNEL: Mark Latrelle
Lieutenant

Starfleet lieutenant and long-time friend of Enterprise NX-01's Malcolm Reed. Hoshi Sato contacted Latrelle in an attempt to learn what Reed's favorite food was, so that she could prepare it for his birthday. Latrelle only remembered that Reed was very fond of a particular seafood restaurant in San Francisco. Reed, however, dislikes seafood - he was more interested in a waitress named Maureen.
