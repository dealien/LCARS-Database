Crewman, U.S.S. Enterprise-D

A beautiful Enterprise-D crew member who inspired Geordi La Forge to create a holodeck program, "Moonlight on the Beach," for their date. Despite the bells and whistles, Henshaw wasn't interested until later that year, when Geordi's self-confidence improved after his neurolink with "John Doe."
