PERSONNEL: Elizabeth Shelby
Lieutenant Commander, tactical officer, Starfleet Command

Ambitious Starfleet officer at the helm of efforts to create Borg defense systems in 2366. She studied Jouret IV for Borg attack data and was later assigned to Starfleet Headquarters. During her research period she was assigned to the U.S.S. Enterprise-D, since it had experience with the Borg. She studied their logs, the crew, and was on board when a single Cube made its way to Earth. After the abduction of Captain Jean-Luc Picard she led an away team to the alien ship where she had an opportunity to observe the cybernetics for herself while looking for the Federation captive. When Riker accepted a field commission of Captain of the Enterprise, she was appointed as executive officer because of her experience with Borg tactical scenarios. Upon the successful rescue she was reassigned to Starfleet Command.
After the Borg threat diminished Shelby was assigned as executive officer to the U.S.S. Excalibur, under the command of her former lover Captain MacKenzie Calhoun. She and crew were assigned to perform humanitarian and diplomatic missions in Sector 221-G, the former Thallonian Empire. After that starship was destroyed she and a majority of the Excalibur's crew were reassigned to the U.S.S. Trident, with Shelby in command. The were reassigned back to the same region of space to continue their previous mission. When Captain Calhoun turned out not to be dead, he was reassigned to a new U.S.S. Excalibur and deployed as a second ship to the same region and he commanded the rest of the crew from the older vessel, those not serving on the Trident.
