PERSONNEL: Vreenak
Senator, Romulus

Romulan Senator who was instrumental in the negotiation of a non-aggression pact signed with the Dominion in 2373. Having been elected in 2360, he was secretary of the war plans council, vice-chairman of the Tal Shiar, and a trusted advisor of Romulan Proconsul Neral. In 2374 he was shown evidence of the Dominion planning to invade Romulus, but denounced it as fake. The evidence survived Vreenak's death when a bomb destroyed his shuttle, and was instrumental in the Romulans forming a new alliance with the Federation and Klingon Empire in the war against the Dominion.
