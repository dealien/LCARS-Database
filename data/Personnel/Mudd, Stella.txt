PERSONNEL: Stella Mudd

Former wife of confidence man Harcourt Fenton Mudd. She was a nagging wife and drove the man from their home and on to long adventures in space. When "Harry" landed on an android planet, he had them make a replica of her so he could have the pleasure of telling her to shut up. After the U.S.S. Enterprise and its crew freed themselves from Harry's abduction, Captain James Kirk commissioned 500 Stella androids and left Harry behind with them.
