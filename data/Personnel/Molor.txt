PERSONNEL: Molor
Emperor, Planetary leader, Qo'noS

Legendary despot who ruled the Klingon people in ancient times. The great Kahless slew Molor with his holy bat'leth, prior to forging the first Klingon Empire. Molor loyalists nearly assassinated Kahless and Lukara moments after their wedding ceremony. At the Maranga IV outpost, Alexander wanted 50 darseks to see Molor's mummified head. The deceased warrior is now featured in several plays and operas performed throughout the Empire- retelling the story of his demise. Such an opera was performed at Maranga IV outpost while Worf and Alexander visisted there.
