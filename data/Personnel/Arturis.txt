PERSONNEL: Arturis

Delta Quadrant inhabitant who held the Voyager crew responsible for his species being assimilated by the Borg. Arturis created an elaborate fake Starfleet ship, the U.S.S. Dauntless, in an attempt to trap the crew and have them be assimilated by the Borg. His plot was discovered and Arturis, ironically, was himself assimilated by the Borg.
