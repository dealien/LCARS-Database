PERSONNEL: Karnas
Planetary leader, Mordan IV

Karnas served as a negotiator when his planet had a civil war in 2319. But instead of striving for a fair solution he extorted weapons from the Federation mediator by taking hostages. Captain Mark Jameson gave over the weapons but also dispensed some to the opposing faction as his form of fair play. 40 years later Karnas wanted to avenge himself on Jameson by taking hostages again, and demanding that now Admiral Jameson be the representative assigned. He felt satisfied after witnessing the Admiral's poor health as a result of Jameson's use of a rare youth drug.
