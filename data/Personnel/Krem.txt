PERSONNEL: Krem

Cowardly cousin of the Ferengi thief Ulis, whose gang raided the Enterprise NX-01 and took the crew hostage. Captain Archer convinced Krem that Ulis wasn't treating him fairly. Later, T'Pol managed to fell Krem via some oo-mox, and a Vulcan nerve pinch. In the end, Archer allowed Krem to take command of Ulis' ship, and Krem took off with the other thieves in shackles.
