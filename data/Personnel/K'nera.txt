PERSONNEL: K'nera
Starship commander, I.K.S.

Klingon officer in command of the ship sent to meet the U.S.S. Enterprise-D to take custody of the outlaws Korris and Konmel and take them to Qo'noS. The two died before they could be taken into Klingon custody, yet K'nera was impressed by Worf's conduct in the matter, and offered him a place in the Klingon Defense Force. 

Reference: Heart of Glory 
Played by David Froman. The Continuum featured an image of the outlaws and Worf during the Death Ritual, but credited that K'nera was among them which is in error. K'nera arrived at the very end of the episode and the Death Ritual was near the beginning.
