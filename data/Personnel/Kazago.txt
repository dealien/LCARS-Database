PERSONNEL: Kazago
Executive officer

DaiMon Bok's first officer in 2364 and unwitting accomplice to a scheme of vengeance upon Captain Jean-Luc Picard. He objected, publicly, to Bok's offer to offer the salvaged U.S.S. Stargazer over to the Federation as a gift, rather than negotiating to sell the ship back to them. Once Bok's non-profit motives were revealed, Kazago sent Bok to the brig and took command.
