PERSONNEL: Hans Hovendaal, M.D.
Chief Medical Officer, Farside Moonbase, Luna

Assisting physician during the birth of the first Terran born off Earth. He made the decision to conduct this procedure in the operating room in case unforeseen extraterrestrial causes may have complicated events. It turned out to be unnecessary as he deemed the delivery free of complications. He ordered that the operating room be slightly decompressed compared to the normal atmospheric pressure maintained within the colony’s domes, and credits that and the low Lunar gravity to have eased pressure on the mother’s contractions and helped the whole birth process. Dr. Hovendaal remained attached to the case to monitor the infant’s early development to assess if the extraterrestrial differences would cause an unique growth pattern in the child, but no such events happened.
