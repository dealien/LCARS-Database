PERSONNEL: Arthur Pendragon
King of the Brittains, Camelot

A ruler on Earth in the 6th century whose tenure became a romanticized legend. He created the Round Table and bestowed honor to knights that sat by his side to provide justice to his people. He wielded Excalibur, a powerful and commanding sword, that had to be returned to the Lady of the Lake upon his death. This man's legend fueled numerous story and honorable traditions. The memory of the man was honored with several starships anemd after him, and even an entire class of vessels.
The holodeck recreation of King Arthur's Court at Camelot provides divertissements for Jadzia Dax and Kira Nerys. Kira and Dax were leaving the holosuite, in full period dress, when they inadvertantly bumped into Lieutenant Commander Worf and met him that way for the first time.
