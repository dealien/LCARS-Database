PERSONNEL: Remata'Klan
Third, Jem'Hadar soldier. 

In 2374, He and his squad crash landed on a planetoid in a nebula within Cardassian space. The First and Second were killed in the accident, but the Vorta, Keevan, would not promote the soldier because he questioned a previous order issued by the Dominion agent. He was ordered to send a message to the Starfleet contingent, also stranded on the planet, which he carried out. The message guaranteed safety to the Federation delegates if they met for talks with the Vorta. Captain Benjamin Sisko, leading the Starfleet team, asked for Remata'Klan's assurance that the officers would be kept safe, telling him that he accepted the word of a Jem'Hadar over that of a Vorta. Sisko was told about the mission that the Vorta would assign to the Jem'Hadar; and Sisko tried to tell Remata'Klan that it was a set-up. Remata'Klan was completely aware that it was a distinctive tactical disadvantage and suspected that it was a trap. Remata'Klan obeyed orders to go on the suicide mission as instructed by the Vorta.
