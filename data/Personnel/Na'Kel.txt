PERSONNEL: Na'Kel
Captain of the Guard, House of Duras, Qo'noS

A member of the House of Duras when she married Tocheck, the House doctor. Na'Kel was employed by the House as a security guard for the compound maintained by the House of Duras. That job included patrolling the grounds, checking security records for incoming flights, and admission of guests and others that wanted permission to enter the property. She reached the rank of lieutenant, and this the highest she could go in rank as long as she was not a part of the House itself.
When Tocheck returned from medical school, he met Na'Kel and they gave birth to two children; N'Nel and Dargo. N'Nel went on to become an architect for the Klingon Navy, designing ships of which he made sure the House of Duras was always first in line to receive the opportunity to acquire. Dargo was sent to the Klingon Defense Force where he learned to be a great warrior in hopes that he would return to the House and take over duties as Captain of the Guard someday.
Once Na'Kel married Tocheck, she was made part of the House of Duras and allowed advancement. She attained captain of the guard soon after. She has installed a training school on the compound where warriors can practice and children on the House can be trained by talented instructors instead of sending them off to school elsewhere.
Personally Na'Kel is not politically minded, so she does not support or dispute the breakup of the House of Duras like her husband and his father which have regular discussions over that issue.
