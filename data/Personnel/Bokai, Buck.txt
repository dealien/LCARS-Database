PERSONNEL: Buck Bokai

Famous baseball player from Earth, one of the game's best ever. Bokai is noted for breaking Joe DiMaggio's consecutive game hitting streak in 2026. Benjamin Sisko was fond of recreating Bokai for his holosuite baseball programs. 

Reference: The Big Goodbye, Past Tense, If Wishes Were Horses, The Storyteller 
Played by Keone Young and Greg Jein for the collector's card. 
The player who broke DiMaggio's record was first mentioned in "The Big Goodbye" but remained nameless until "If Wishes Were Horses where it appeared on a baseball card proposed by DS9 Illustrator (and baseball fan) Richard Delgado as a decorative prop for Ben Sisko's quarters. Fellow baseball fan (and executive producer) Michael Piller suggested the card feature a 21st Century player, which would make it a valuable collector's item to the 24th century owner. Model maker Greg Jein (also a baseball fan) provided photos of himself in a baseball jersey that the art department converted into the prop card. Greg also provided the fictional history of the character and the statistics that appeared on the back of the card. Bokai, whose name was a vague allusion to Buckaroo Banzai, from the movie of the same name, was mentioned in "The Storyteller" but was not seen until "If Wishes were Horses" when actor Young was cast and who bore an uncanny resemblance to Jein. The prop baseball card, which was revised after the episode, has Young's photo on the front, and Jein's photo on the back.
