PERSONNEL: Edward Jellico
Admiral, operations officer, Starfleet Headquarters

A Starfleet officer with a solid history of achievement. During his brief captaincy of the U.S.S. Enterprise NCC-1701-D, in 2369, he proved to be an unpopular and unnecessarily stern taskmaster. 
Jellico was later promoted to Admiral and worked in an office near Alynna Nechayev. He was of influence in the assignment of crewmen to the U.S.S. Excalibur under Captain McKenzie Calhoun. He appointed Commander Elizabeth Shelby since she was a stern manager like himself. He expected regular reports on the activities of the unorthodox captain. He was equally influential when he referred a first officer to now Captain Shelby when she earned her own command.
