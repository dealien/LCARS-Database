PERSONNEL: Dennis Kim

Human male residing on Earth, cousin of Harry Kim. In 2377, after the U.S.S. Voyager established datastream contact with the Federation, Dennis sent Harry a letter which referenced a mutual friend, Maxwell Saroyan, who was killed by the Maquis a number of years prior. This letter, in Tuvok's eyes, implicated Harry in the attacks on Maquis crewmembers aboard Voyager, but those suspicions proved unfounded.
