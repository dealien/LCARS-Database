PERSONNEL: Murphy
Ensign, security officer, U.S.S. Voyager

Torres apparently found Murphy quite attractive, even though he was seeing one of the Delaney sisters in 2373. Murphy also served on the Bridge, in charge of shields and in the sciences department. After the Voyager crew detained the displaced Ferengi citizens, Dr. Arridor and Kol, Murphy was ordered to escort them to secured quarters when he was overpowered, allowing the two to escape into the shuttlebay.
