PERSONNEL: Dirgo
Captain, transport pilot, Nenebek

Pentaran shuttle pilot who was assigned to transport Captain Picard and Ensign Crusher from the Enterprise-D on his mining shuttle the Nenebek to a conference on his home planet of Pentarus V in 2367. The dilapidated shuttle malfunctioned and Dirgo had to crash-land it on Lambda Paz, a barely Class-M moon in the Pentaran system. In the ensuing struggle for survival on the desert world, Dirgo was reluctant to accept Picard's authority. Trying to reach a source of water being protected by a forcefield, Dirgo's impulsive actions with a phaser got him killed by an electrical "sentry."
