PERSONNEL: Tressa

Drayan female about to die of old age, in 2372, despite appearing as a little girl. She and some other elders were transported to one of the Drayan moons to carry out her final ritual. Their shuttle crashed and all of their attendants died, leaving the elders alone. The U.S.S. Voyager detected the crash and offered to help. Lieutenant Tuvok calmed Tressa's fears until Drayan attendants arrived to guide Tressa to her final ritual. The Drayan officials pointed out that the crew were interfering with their cultural beliefs. The Voyager crew left the moon and allowed the crash survivors to complete their final ritual, even though it meant their deaths.
