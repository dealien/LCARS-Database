PERSONNEL: Tekeny Ghemor
Legate, Cardassia Prime

Celebrated leader of the Cardassian dissident movement, unmasked in an elaborate ruse involving a surgically-altered Kira Nerys in 2371. His work was suspected by the Obsidian Order who sought a plan to expose his duplicity. The Order told the legate that his daughter, Iliana, had returned from a ten-year covert mission where her identity was altered and her mind conditioned. The Order captured Kira Nerys and altered her to resemble Iliana. When the Order told Ghemor that his "daughter" was not reacting properly to the mind drugs they were going to have to kill her. Ghemor contacted his allies within the underground to help Iliana/Kira escape. The plan exposed Ghemor's contacts within the underground and confirmed the Obsidian Order's suspicions that he was a traitor. Ghemor was also evacuated from the planet with the help of personnel from Deep Space 9 that included Garak. He went into asylum with the Mathenites and awaited the real return of his daughter.
After developing terminal Yarim Fel syndrome in 2373, Ghemor journeyed to Deep Space Nine for a final visit with Kira.
