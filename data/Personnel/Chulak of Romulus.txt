PERSONNEL: Chulak
Military leader, Romulus

Legendary Romulan who suffered a humiliating defeat at Galorndon Core, much in the same way Napolean met his Waterloo on ancient Earth. The nefarious Clown of the Kohl dreamstate used Chulak as an example of how a defeated party is in no position to issue an ultimatum.
