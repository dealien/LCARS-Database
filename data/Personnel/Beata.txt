PERSONNEL: Beata
Mistress, planetary leader, Angel One

The "Elected One" on planet Angel One. As head of that world's government, Beata was intent on preserving the matriarchal culture that rendered males to second-class status there. However, after being impressed with Will Riker of the U.S.S. Enterprise-D, she took the progressive step of not executing Federation fugitives who had rejected the female-dominated government, and instead exiled them to a remote area of the planet. She acknowledged that her society's oppressive tradition might eventually change over time.
