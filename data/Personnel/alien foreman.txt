PERSONNEL: alien foreman

The unethical Alien Foreman was in charge of the Delphic Expanse trellium-D mining facility visited by Archer and the crew of the Enterprise NX-01. He required an inhaler to breathe, as the toxic fumes from the mines had ruined his lungs. The Foreman made a deal with Archer - he would allow the captain to meet with a Xindi worker in exchange for liquefied platinum. The Foreman had another motive, however. He planned on recruiting the entire crew as slaves for his mines. Luckily, Lieutenant Reed and the MACOs saved Archer and foiled the plan. The Foreman was shot by one of the MACOs during the escape.
