PERSONNEL: drill thralls

Beings captured throughout the galaxy and brought to planet Triskelion by a group of disembodied brains known as the Providers. These unfortunate captives, called drill thralls, were branded by one of the three Providers and trained to fight. They spent the rest of their lives in competition to amuse their masters, until Captain James Kirk persuaded the Providers to free the thralls in 2267.
