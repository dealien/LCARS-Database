PERSONNEL: Kamala

An empathic metamorph from the Krios system transported by the U.S.S. Enterprise-D to Valt Minor. She was the first of her kind born on her world in a century. She was raised from childhood to fulfill her role as an instrument of peace and fated to marry Chancellor Alrik of the Valt Minor System. Like all empathic metamorphs her ability to change into whatever a potential mate might want made her irresistible to men. 
When she came aboard the Enterprise, Kamala was already in the final stages of the Finiis'ral stage of sexual maturity, causing disruptions aboard the ship. Kamala had been intended to bond with Alrik, but when circumstances put her in close contact with Captain Jean-Luc Picard, she bonded with him. From her brief joining with Picard she learned a sense of purpose and duty that would be important for her work as a peacemaker. Despite accidentally bonding with Picard, Kamala fulfilled her duty and married Chancellor Alrik.
