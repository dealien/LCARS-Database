PERSONNEL: Albert, Joshua
Cadet, Starfleet Academy

A member of Starfleet Academy's elite Nova Squadron who died when his and four other ships crashed at the Academy Flight Range near Saturn in 2368. Hearings on the accident initially pointed to pilot error on the cadet's part, which devastated his father, Lt. Commander Albert. But later testimony by Wesley Crusher revealed that the squadron was attempting to perform the prohibited Kolvoord Starburst in honor of commencement exercises, and when the maneuver when awry, only Albert was unfortunate enough not to beam out in time.
