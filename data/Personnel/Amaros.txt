Councillor, planetary leader, Volan III

A member of the Maquis group. He used his position on the council to collect information for the terrorists and to try to bring about policy that would be in favor of the group.
In 2370 he was present when Gul Evek informed the council about the attacks on the Federation merchant ships, the Cardassian freighter Rak Minunis, and when Commander Sisko and Dukat showed up. All witnessed fellow colonist Bill Samuels "confession" being involved in the bombing of the transport and heard tha he died in Cardassian hands. He was among the group that abducted Gul Dukat from Deep Space 9. He was found by Commander Sisko and Odo trying to interrogate Dukat and was captured. He was later released by Sisko to send a message to the Maquis leader, former Starfleet Commander Calvin Hudson, that Hudson could still retain his commission and end the terrorist activities. And he piloted the modified Peregrine-class vessel that the Maquis turned into a small fighter, the Niles, for an attack on a Cardassian supply depot; which was thwarted when Deep Space 9 personnel intervened.
