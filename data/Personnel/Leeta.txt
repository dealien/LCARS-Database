PERSONNEL: Leeta

A beautiful and smart Bajoran Dabo girl working for Quark's bar, Leeta combines the best of Bajoran traditions with her very untraditional lifestyle. After dating Dr. Bashir for over a year, she developed a crush on Rom during the strike by Quark's employees in 2372. After resolving her affair with Bashir using the Bajoran Rite of Separation on Risa, she followed a rocky path with the shy Rom until he finally proposed and they wed on the eve of the Dominion invasion of 2373-74. Rom's elevation to Grand Nagus in 2375 essentially made Leeta the "first lady" of Ferengi society. 
An amateur sociologist, she knew of the Trill zhian'tara ceremony and, as a friend, embodied former host Emony the gymnast for Jadzia Dax in 2371. 
Leeta had been offered a position as restaurant manager of a cafe on Jupiter station by Dr. Louis Zimmerman as an attempt by the man to lure the beautiful woman to his side. She debated the issue until Rom confessed his love for her which Leeta had been waiting to here and decided to remain on Deep Space 9.
