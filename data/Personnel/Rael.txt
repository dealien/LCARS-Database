PERSONNEL: Rael

Scalosian male who boarded the U.S.S. Enterprise in 2268 in an attempt to cryogenically freeze the crew and use the males for breeding stock. Like all the males on planet Scalos, Rael was sterile due to radiation contamination on his planet. Although he intellectually realized the need to propagate his species by forcing alien males to mate with Scalosian females, he became jealous of the pairing of Captain James Kirk and Deela.
