PERSONNEL: Tonia Barrows
Yeoman, U.S.S. Enterprise

Crew member of the U.S.S. Enterprise in 2267 who joined the landing party on the world that later came to be known as the "amusement park planet." Unaware that her fantasies would be instantly fabricated into reality by the planet's sophisticated equipment, the helplessly romantic Barrows conjured up a replica of Don Juan. Later when she was alone with Dr. McCoy, she imagined herself a fairy-tale princess and found herself dressed in a long flowing gown. She then inadvertently created a black knight which attacked and killed Dr. McCoy (although he was later revived in the planet's underground facility).
