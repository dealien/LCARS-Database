PERSONNEL: Nidell Seyetik

Wife of Professor Gideon Seyetik, Nidell possessed psychoprojective telepathic powers which she used to create Fenna, another version of herself. Fenna acted as a means to supplement her otherwise unfulfilling marriage. When Nidell experienced deep emotional distress and lost control of her special telepathic abilities, Fenna was the result. Fenna, who was composed of pure energy and looked exactly like Nidell, sought the happiness that Nidell couldn't have. Nidell was depressed by the flamboyant attitude of her husband- like his previous eight wives; but as a citizen of New Halana she was compelled to remain married for life. Gideon was well aware of Fenna and the cause. When Fenna met Commander Benjamin Sisko on station Deep Space Nine the two immediately fell in love. In 2370 Gideon manned a shuttlepod during his attempt to re-ignite Epsilon 119 and died in the process relieving her of her marriage obligations. Unfortunately when Nidell's emotional problems were resolved, Fenna ceased to exist.
