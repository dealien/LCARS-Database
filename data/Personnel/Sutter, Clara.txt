PERSONNEL: Clara Sutter

Daughter of Enterprise-D crew member Daniel Sutter. Because she had changed starships (and therefore homes) so many times in her young life, Clara invented an "invisible friend," Isabella, to keep her company. Clara was at first pleased, then frightened, when her imaginary companion suddenly became very real.

Portrayed by Noley Thornton, whom also played Taya in "Shadowplay."
