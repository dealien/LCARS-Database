PERSONNEL: Ned Quint

Resident of Caldos Colony and friend of Felisa Howard. Quint was caretaker for Felisa's estate during her life. Following Felisa's death Quint warned granddaughter and heir, Beverly Crusher to rid herself of her grandmother's house and most particularly the Howard family candle, which Ned felt summoned the family ghost. Quint felt the ghost had been a curse on the Howard family for generations. He was killed at the weather control substation, apparently by Ronin.
