PERSONNEL: Agent 347

A human raised on an unknown alien planet, then returned to Earth in the 1960s with a mission to protect humanity from its own self-destructive nature. This agent, and the partner Agent 201, were killed in an automobile accident before they could complete their task, so their mission fell to Supervisor 194, also known as Gary Seven. They had worked in an office with the assistance of Roberta Lincoln as their office secretary, and the M5 computer that was furnished by the aliens.
