PERSONNEL: Rake d'Aleseo
Captain of the Guard, ancient Andorian castle

This captain was a regular guest at the "Captain's Table" bar, and often seen at times when Captain Julius Ramsey entered it. He was in charge of security of an old castle on Andor, before the planet became unified and experienced a renaissance or industrial revolution. As a regular patron he was well aware that people from the future, the past, and the present, from all races in the galaxy, came together to meet in the bar; and he was well aware of the rules regarding their visits.
