PERSONNEL: William Cliff Ross
Vice Admiral, station commander, Starbase 375

Admiral Bill Ross was Captain Benjamin Sisko's direct superior. As such, he coordinated the Federation Alliance's efforts to drive the Dominion out of the Alpha and Beta Quadrants. Eventually, his leadership of a joint Federation-Klingon-Romulan fleet forced Dominion forces to surrender on Cardassia Prime, thus ending the Dominion War.
