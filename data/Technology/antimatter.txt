CHEMISTRY: antimatter

Particles that are identical but exactly opposite to traditional particles. The electrons spin in opposite directions from their counterparts causing opposite charges. When the two collide they completely annihilate each other and release vast amounts of energy in the process.
Terrans first discovered antimatter after years of speculation in 2017 by the UNP U Thant, Stellar-series probe, outside of the orbit of Pluto within their own star system.
