TECHNOLOGY: emergency transporter armbands

Devices that can remotely activate a transporter. Emergency armbands are used by Starfleet personnel when they expect to be in a situation where they may not have time to verbally contact their ship and request transport. They may also be used to generate subspace forcefields around the wearer to protect from temporal disturbances.
