TECHNOLOGY: Guardian of Forever

Time portal created by an unknown civilization on a distant planet at least five billion years ago. The Guardian resembled a large, roughhewn torus about three meters in diameter. It was a sentient device, able to respond to questions, although the sophistication of its programming was so great that it was difficult for humans to understand it. The Guardian was discovered in 2267 by U.S.S. Enterprise personnel who were investigating time-distortion waves in the vicinity. Dr. McCoy, suffering from an accidental overdose of cordrazine when the ship by a time wave, fled into Earth's past through the Guardian. While in the past, McCoy affected a change in the flow of history, creating a new future in which the Starship Enterprise did not exist. Kirk and Spock followed McCoy to Earth's 1930s, where they learned that McCoy had prevented the death of American social worker Edit Keeler. In this altered history, Keeler prevented the entry of the United States into World War II long enough for Nazi Germany to devlop weapons that allowed Hitler to dominate the world. Kirk and Spock were able to prevent McCoy from saving Keeler, and upon her death, time resumed its original course. The origin and purpose of the Guardian remains a total mystery, but Guardian described itself as its own beginning and its own end.
