TECHNOLOGY: refrigeration unit

Also known as a cryostatis generator in medical terms. One such unit was added to the life-support system of the U.S.S. Enterprise NCC-1701 in 2268 by commandeering Scalosians, who meant to keep the crew in stasis until needed to help repopulate their sterile species. 
Refrigeration units were also aboard assorted vessels of aliens that ate non-replicated foods to prevent spoilage of the foodstuffs.  Klingon ships had large refrigerated rooms where they kept their meat hanging until it was prepared for a meal. As Starfleet converted to replicated foods these rooms were phased out. The U.S.S. Voyager had to build one of these after the captain decided to ration replicator use to conserve energy and fuel consumption after being stranded in the distant Delta Quadrant.

It is assumed that the U.S.S. Voyager added one of these since they chose to stop replicating their foods.
