CHEMISTRY: Multiflux Gamma Radiation

Extremely deadly form of Multiflux Radiation.  The Enterprise NCC-1701 was hit by 30 kilovolts of it when a Romulan bird-of-prey with a prototype singularity drive exploded in 2268.  Several crewmembers were taken ill, and Doctor McCoy commented the multiflux gamma radiation alone was not sufficient to cause such problems.
