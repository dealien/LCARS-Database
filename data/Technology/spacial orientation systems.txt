TECHNOLOGY: spatial orientation systems

Part of the holodeck computer network. These systems control the orientation of objects created within the holodeck. When character in the holodeck of the U.S.S. Enterprise NCC-1701-D began exhibiting changes in their dominant hands (right-handed characters became left-handed and the reverse), a malfunction in the orientation systems was suspected as the cause of the problem.
