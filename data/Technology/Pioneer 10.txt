PROBES: PIONEER 10

Ancient robotic space probe launched in 1972 by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. It weighed 570 pounds. Pioneer 10 was the first human-made object pass through the Sol asteroid belt, visit Jupiter, and to leave the Sol System. It was also the first to use a planet's gravity to change its course and speed; enough to reach the velocity to break Sol's gravity. It was scheduled to operate until the early 21st century when its power cells would go dead and the onboard instruments would cease working. 
The probe drifted for centuries in the interstellar void until it was destroyed by a B'rel-class bird-of-prey piloted by Captain Klaa. It was expected to drift for 300,000 years until it reached a point 3 light years from star Ross 248 in the Terran constellation of Taurus.

Reference: The Final Frontier
In 1998 Voyager 1, which was launched in 1977 and traveled much faster than the Pioneer model, became humanity's most distant spacecraft as of 2002. The Pioneer 10 mdel used in The Final Frontier was built by Greg Jein with technical assistance provided by TRW, Inc., and Richard O. Fimmel, Pioneer project manager for NASA's Ames Research Center. Fimmel wasn't told that the craft was going to be blown up in the movie.
