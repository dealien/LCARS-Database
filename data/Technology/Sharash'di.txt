RECREATION: Sharash’di

A game of strategy favored by Lieutenant Vigo.  His friend Charlie Kochman, who had acquired it from a Yridian salesman on Beta Nopterix, gave it to him as a birthday present, and the Pandrilite soon played it whenever he had the chance. It consisted of a wooden board, with skillfully carved terrain and simulations of various natural features.
