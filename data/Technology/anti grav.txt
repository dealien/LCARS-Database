TECHNOLOGY: anti grav

Anti-gravity repeller technology used in hand-held grips or pallets to allow handling of overly massive cargo, and in medical rehabilitation therapy. 
Two antigravs were attached to Nomad to move the robot to the transporter room before it self-destructed in 2267.  
In 2268, Captain Kirk and Ensign Garrovick carried an antimatter bomb to planet Tycho IV with one.  
The Medusan ambassador Kollos was also carried in his protective chamber by an antigrav device. 
A malfunctioning antigrav pallet was one of the first clues Barclay realized when tracing invidium contamination on the U.S.S. Enterprsie-D in 2366. 
Dr. Julian Bashir once prescribed use of an antigrav to a Deep Space Nine worker with a back injury.
