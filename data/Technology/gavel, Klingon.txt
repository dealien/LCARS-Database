TECHNOLOGY: gavel

A tool used by judges to make a statement official; like to order an adjournment, to proceed to the next phase of trial, or to close a case. A gavel is also used as a tool to gain the attention of an unruly group. Committee chairpersons use a gavel to call a meeting to order, end a period of voting, and to signal the close of a meeting.
Terran gavels were wooden hammerlike devices. Klingon gavels were rock spheres used with a protective glove struck against flint or energized plate which cast sparks or electric bolts. Starfleet military gavels used a bell and metal stick.
