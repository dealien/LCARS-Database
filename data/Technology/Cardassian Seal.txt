TECHNOLOGY: Cardassian Seal

Force shield seal used by Cardassians to protect their most prized possessions. The seal was wrapped entirely around a box, exerting a force shield designed to react unpredictably with force manipulators, energy beams, or brute physical tools.  To be opened, the seal required a precise sequence of radio-wave frequencies transmitted to it, theoretically, this could only be done with a matching Cardassian key ring.    An incorrect frequency would cause the seal to detonate, thus causing the destruction of the contents of the box and perhaps injuring the person trying to open it.  Quark was one of the few Ferengi who could pick a Cardassian seal.
