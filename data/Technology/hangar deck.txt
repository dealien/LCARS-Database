TECHNOLOGY: hangar deck

The shuttlecraft landing and storage facility found aboard Federation starships, derived from terran naval parlance. More modern usage of the 24th century has referred to the area as a shuttlebay. On Constitution, Excelsior, Ambassador, Intrepid and other classes of vessels the hangar deck was located at the rear of the engineering section with large telescoping doors on the aft. Most hangar decks are multiple levels tall and include an observation corridor and control room above the main landing deck. And many starships are equipped with lift systems to raise and lower craft to decks below the hangar area where the craft can be taken for heavy maintenance or stored to keep the main deck clear for use.

During TOS the hangar deck was a miniature set supplemented with a small portion that was built full-sized.
