CHEMISTRY: omega

A molecule believed by many to have the potential to be the ultimate energy source. Even a single molecule can produce more energy than a Federation warp core, and some scientists believe that Omega molecules may have been the energy source behind the Big Bang which created the universe. Omega molecules are highly unstable and their decay can cause damage to subspace over large areas, rendering the use of warp drive impossible. The Federation regards the use of Omega molecules to be a serious threat to interstellar travel throughout the galaxy, and starship captains are authorized to use any and all means to destroy the molecules wherever they are found - an order which supersedes even the prime directive. Discussion of omega theory is otherwise classified. The Borg revere the omega particle, or article 010, and go to extreme lengths to acquire its perfection.
A group of Ferengi explorers discovered a stable omega particle and conspired with the Cardassians to sell their discovery. Romulan scouts learned of the transaction and out bid the neighboring power for the particle. The Tal Shiar took control of the project and hid the element at a secret base within the Gamma Quadrant. The Borg assimilated the project commander and learned of its presence, then ran a successful campaign to collect the particle. When the Federation learned of this they recruited the Klingons and Romulans into traveling to the Borg base and destroyed the particle before the Borg were able to use its awesome power to fuel an attack.
