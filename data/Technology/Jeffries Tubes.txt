TECHNOLOGY: Jeffries Tubes

A complex network of barely passable crawl spaces supporting a web of ODN cables, power conduits, plumbing, and air-circulation channels. They were used usually to allow hands-on contact to critical circuitry and serve as emergency access in times of power outage. The term dates to the earliest days of Starship design. In 2369, Lt. Cmdr. Nella Darren used a Jefferies Tube junction on the Galaxy-class Enterprise as a concert hall for its acoustics. 
Cardassians call such spaces tiyerta nok; which directly translates into "the life-flow of iron" or "the arteries of the machine."

Reference: Fall of Terok Nor
The term started out as a behind the scenes joke made during the original series of Star Trek, in honor of Matt Jeffries who was the Art Director and responsible for the creation of the starship and the engineering access ports. It became canon during TNG.
