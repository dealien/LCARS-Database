In the case of Miramanee's Amerind planet, the native designation of a deflector-beam generator built by the progenitor species dubbed the Preservers to protect the planet. Its surface was inscribed with symbols in a tonal alphabet which described how to operate the deflector. The knowledge of the symbols was passed down from one medicine man to the next within the tribe until one such failed to do so and left the planet in danger of an asteroid strike in 2268. The crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise NCC-1701 were able to deduce the generator's operation and reactivate it.
