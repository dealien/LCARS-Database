TECHNOLOGY: dilithium chamber hatch

Exterior door of the matter/antimatter reaction chamber, part of the warp drive of a starship. The hatch gives crewmen access to the dilithium crystal articulation frame when the frame requires service or the crystals need replacing. 
The hatch on the U.S.S. Enterprise-D failed in early 2367, resulting in a massive explosion in the ship's engine room. Although sabotage was initially suspected, it was later found that undetectable submicron fractures had existed in a defective hatch installed on the ship at Earth Station McKinley earlier that year.
