TECHNOLOGY: intercom

A wall or console mounted voice communications terminal. This allowed persons throughout the ship to communicate with each other, and provided for a public address system. Intercom stations fell in disuse in later Federation starships as the personal communicator provided remote access to the ship's internal communications network. They could still be found on commercial and civilian ships where the persons were not carrying individual devices.
