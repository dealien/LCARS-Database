TECHNOLOGY: Spontaneous Quantum Event

General term for freak accidents concerning wormholes. Such an event an cause temporal displacement of an object traveling through the wormhole. The maximum displacement possible to be caused by the Wormhole without external energy added was estimated to be 200 standard years, plus or minus ten years. The amount of energy needed to produce a temporal displacement of five thousand years is more than a starship could produce with anything short of a total warp-core explosion.
