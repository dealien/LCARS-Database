TECHNOLOGY: access tunnel

Also known as Jeffries Tubes. Maintenance corridors on starships and space stations out of reach of non-engineering crew. On Deep Space Nine they allowed station personnel access to vital circuitry and other utilities. In 2369, a Bajoran resistance device hidden in a tunnel leading to food replicator circuits and designed to spread an aphasia virus was inadvertently activated. 
Neela Darren found intersect of Jeffreis Tube 25 to be the most accoustically perfect spot on the Enterprise-D for playing her musical instruments. Jeffres Tubes were even used for physical fitness training aboard the Starship Voyager where holodeck time was rationed.

The term Jeffries Tube was a gag among the original Star Trek production staff, a reference to TOS art director Matt Jeffries, the man who designed the original Starship Enterprise. Access to critical systems from inside the starship was considered to be important instead of requiring a vessel to have to pull in to port for repairs, or spending time on expensive extra-vehicular activity which would have been costly for the show. In TNG the term has actually been used on film, this making the name "official." Using tubes and tunnels also allowed for the exterior of the spacecraft to be more streamlined and smooth, and not requiring numerous access points and covers.
