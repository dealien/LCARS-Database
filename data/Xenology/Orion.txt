XENOLOGY: Orion
LOCATION: Alpha Quadrant
GOVERNMENT: Orion Syndicate

(pronounced "oh-RYE-uns") Planet name unspecified, within the Orion system. A green-skinned species of humanoid traders with known dealings in the black market, and questionable intentions towards the Federation. Orions are known to have bartered their female dancers at one time. 
The Syndicate is run by a monarchy with an extended family of descendants responsible for large areas. Each prince often recruits extensive networks of other aliens to work for the organization since Orion nationals are too easily recognized within Federation controlled space. Starfleet Intelligence spends a lot of time and resources trying to infiltrate the crime group to collect enough evidence to close down each local operation. 
Orions were reported to have transported half the population of a village on Brinda V to work as slave labor in mining camps, another example of a space-faring race - like Cardassians - who have relied on manual labor rather than technology for tasks considered menial. 
The last time an Orion was dissatisfied at Quark's, the damage took a week to repair. An Orion ambassador was at Deep Space Nine in 2370 for the Bajoran Trade Delegation for talks regarding trade with Bajor.
