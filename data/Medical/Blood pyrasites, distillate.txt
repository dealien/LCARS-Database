MEDICAL: Blood pyrasites, distillate

To put Federation negotiator Mendoza out of commission during the Barzan wormhole bargaining in 2366, the Ferengi used a distillate of their own Daimon's blood pyrasites to wreak a serious allergic reaction. Dr. Arridor took a sample of the yellowish Ferengi blood from Daimon Goss' neck, then rubbed the distillate into his daimon's palm -- where it turned deep blue-green -- to make contact in a handshake.
