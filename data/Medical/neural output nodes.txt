MEDICAL: neural output pods

A specific component of the VISOR worn by the sightless U.S.S. Enterprise Chief Engineer Geordi La Forge, enabling him to see. This component of the VISOR transmits the visual data directly into brain. In 2366, while stranded on planet Galorndorn Core, La Forge and the Romulan Bochra used the VISOR's neural output pods connected to a tricorder in an effort to detect a neutrino beacon which would lead to their rescue.
