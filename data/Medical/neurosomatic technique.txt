MEDICAL: neurosomatic technique

The alien medical procedure employed on planet Tilonus IV in 2369 during the inhabitant's effort to extract strategic information from Commander William Riker. The commander's Captors used this technique to create a delusional world which they could control, and in which Commander Riker believed he was an inmate at the Tilonus Institute for Mental Disorders, being held there on a count of murder. However, Commander Riker's subconscious mind also incorporated into this delusional world elements of a play called Frame of Mind. This provided some connection to reality, which in turn, allowed Commander Riker's mind to create a defense mechanism against the neurosomatic process.
