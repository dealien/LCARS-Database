MEDICAL: Tsiolkovsky infection

A waterborne viral infection that acts as a depressant on the body's neural system, lowering inhibitions by acquiring carbon from the body and acting on the brain as an intoxicant. The disease and a strain similar to it that infected the original U.S.S. Enterprise NCC-1701 starship some 80 years before have both occurred during huge shifts in gravity, as at a large collapsing stellar body. It takes its name from an away team checking on the dead science ship SS Tsiolkovsky that had been monitoring a red supergiant's collapse into a white dwarf. A pale pinkish antidote from the earlier case doesn't work again, and Doctor Crusher finally discovered one that works now. Remmick questions Lieutenant Worf during his interrogation for Admiral Quinn about Picard's handling of the incident on stardate 41416.2.
