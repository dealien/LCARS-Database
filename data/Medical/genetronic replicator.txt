MEDICAL: genetronic replicator

Developed by neurogeneticist Doctor Toby Russell, an experimental medical device able to translate a particular genetic code into a specific set of replication directions which instruct the replicative device to "grow" a fitting replacement organ. Doctor Russell was refused three requests to begin testing her device on humanoid patients by Starfleet Medical until her successful -- if not somewhat questionable -- implementation of the technique on Lieutenant Worf in 2368.
