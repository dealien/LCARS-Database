MEDICAL: Life Prolongation Project

Failed experiment attempted by scientists on the so-called Miri's planet, originally designed to create an age-retarding virus for use in humans. Instead, the virus killed the entire adult population and slowed down aging in children until they died upon entering puberty. In 2266, Dr. McCoy was able to create an antidote for the virus.
