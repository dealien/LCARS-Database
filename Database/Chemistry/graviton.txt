CHEMISTRY: Graviton

Elementary particle of matter that transmits gravitational energy, responsible for the gravitational force which exists between all masses in our universe. Gravitons can be artificially generated by Federation starships, and have various uses. The Enterprise-D used gravitons in an attempt to communicate with the crystalline entity, for example. Heavy gravitons can be highly destructive and this form of weapon was considered for use against the Borg by the Enterprise crew, although it was decided that the weapon would probably be insufficient. In 2368 graviton waves destroyed the USS Vico, and nearly destroyed the USS Enterprise, when they interacted with the power of the ships shields. Some artificial gravity systems operate by creating gravitons. 
Antigravitons are produced by certain alien technologies, and can be used to interfere with transporter beams.
