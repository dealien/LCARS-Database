CHEMISTRY: corbomite

Fictional element conjurred up by Captain James Kirk as part of a bluff against a more powerful adversary. When confronted by the Fesarius of the First Federation, Kirk claimed that the U.S.S. Enterprise was stocked with corbomite, a powerful explosive that can reflect damaging energy back at its source, so that if the Fesarius did attack the starship the larger ship would be destoryed as well. While scans of the Enterprise database by Balok, the adversarial commander, did not reveal any information about the chemical, the commander had to consider the possibility. The delay worked long enough to convince the two crews to develop friendly relations after all.
