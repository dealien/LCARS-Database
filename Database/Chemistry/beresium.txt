CHEMISTRY: beresium

A mineral found in mixed dirt clusters and needs to be refined from its ore to be useful.
The asteroid that hit the home planet of the human Terra Nova colony contained this as a primary geological element. The thermo-shock of the impact created the "poison rain" that drove the surviving colonists underground.
