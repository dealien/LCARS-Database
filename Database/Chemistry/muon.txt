CHEMISTRY: muon
 
An unstable particle similar to an electron, but with a much greater mass. Muons are part of the Lepton family. A build up of Muons in a Federation warp core can result in a massive explosion if the ship enters warp. This is especially dangerous as the build up is very difficult to detect.
