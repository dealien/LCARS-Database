CITY: Selenium

Capital city of the planet Nelkar. A relatively small population for a capital, it was also unique by its cobbled together appearance. Many of its buildings were assembled from salvaged items from various other places. Starfleet personnel recognized an Andorian domed building which was assumed to have been taken from an abandoned Andorian settlement just outside the sector. Another building was observed with an Orion Eye likely taken off an Orion slave transport.
