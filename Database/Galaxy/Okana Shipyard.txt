STATION: Okana Shipyard

Major shipyard on Bajor, located in the Okana Desert.  According to Kira, the shipyard was operational for centuries and had plays and songs written about it.  During the Occupation, the Cardassians kept the shipyard open despite the fact that no ships were being built there. The person responsible for the shipyards being kept open was the Director, Amkot Groell, who collaborated with the Cardassians in order to keep the shipyards open as a museum.  In 2370, the Federation allowed one of their Starships, the U.S.S. Hannibal, to be constructed at the shipyard despite the fact that it was a land-based shipyard and crude by Federation standards.  The shipyard consisted of six pits spread across the Desert, each one crisscrossed by six gigantic arches that curved to an apex almost a kilometre above ground.
