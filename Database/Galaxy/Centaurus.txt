PLANET: Centaurus
SYSTEM: Centauri
SECTOR: Centauri
QUADRANT: Beta

Inhabited planet orbiting Alpha Centauri A. Home to the Centaurans, the planet is also a human colony.   The planet was united in the late seventeenth century by Zalar Mag'nees.  Even after her death, her philosophy of subterfuge and concealment remained, inciting the Centaurans to do things such as send signals by wire and bury power plants. Thus, the Centaurans civilization was not discovered by Earth until the first human ship entered the system after 2063.    The U.S.S. Enterprise NCC-1701 visited Centaurus in 2269 to pick up nominees for the Nobel and Z-Magnees Prizes.
