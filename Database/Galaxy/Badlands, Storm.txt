Roughly spherical plasma storm eighty-four parsecs in width.  Exerts a strong gravitational pull and casts a sensor "shadow" that blocks readings nearby.  Has kiloelectron voltages exceeding the eighth power.  There is variability in frequency and intensity in optical and radio pulsations by ten thousand times.  Discovered in 2268 by the U.S.S. Enterprise NCC-1701.  Named by Captain Kirk. Relatively near the Romulan Star Empire.
