Kira told the residents of Deep Space Nine and the Cardassian officials that any complaints regarding the brawl at Quark's should be taken up with the legal office. 
In 2370, the cargo bays were only given marginal heat to save power and keep supplies from freezing. As of 2370, only fusion reactors 1 and 2 were operation since the other 4 reactors had too many leaks and problems to be operational. Aside from Ops, the weapons sails were the most shielded spots on DS9.  Miles O’Brien instructed his wife to go there if there was ever an emergency on the station.
