Earth's location in the galaxy made it difficult to "stumble on to," which is why no one noticed the planet until Zephram Cochrane's warp flight in 2063. In March 2153 a Xindi destroyer/probe struck Earth with an energy beam that carved a swath from Florida to Venezuela.  Seven million people were killed in the attack, including Elizabeth Tucker.
