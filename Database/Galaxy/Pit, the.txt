STATE: The Pit
PLANET: Xenex
SYSTEM:
SECTOR: 221H
QUADRANT: Alpha

An area of Xenex roughly 30 miles across, known for its inhospitable clime- unpredictable weather, dust storms, and torrential rain followed by scorching drought, among other horrors- and its vicious local fauna. The Pit also is regarded by some local dwellers too have supernatural overtones, and it sometimes is referred to as a rift in reality or as a nexus for multiple realities. Until recently, it was the destination for a Xenexian coming-of-age ritual known as the “Search for Allways.”
