SYSTEM: Beta Barritus
SECTOR:
QUADRANT:

Solar system containing a Lazarus Star surrounded by a thick layer of gases. It was the hiding place of the pirate known as the White Wolf. When the U.S.S. Stargazer passed the debris barrier around the star, it encountered dangerous energy vortices that had already caused three other ships–the U.S.S. Mongoose, the U.S.S. Leningrad and the U.S.S. Christopher–to turn back.
