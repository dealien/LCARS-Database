PLANET: Argelius
SYSTEM: Ciatella
SECTOR: Tau Ceti
QUADRANT: Beta

Four days form Earth at warp speed.  So superficially similar to Earth’s middle eastern culture that it is assumed they were seeded by the Preservers millenia ago.  Passionless culture.  Planet is neutral despite being located in space disputed by the Federation and the Klingon.  Inhabitants were warlike but have evolved into being so passive that not even the children quarrel.  Hence, they even import all administrators to run their planet for them.  Some of the women are telepathic.  The entire society is very poor.  There is no class distinction.  Some streets remain unnamed even after centuries.  Yelgor City is one of only three cities on the planet and has small villages scattered around it.  

Reference: Battlestations!
This was stated to be in the Tau Ceti Quadrant but subsequent facts have revealed that there is no such Quadrant name. This entry was modified to conform with established Trek facts.
