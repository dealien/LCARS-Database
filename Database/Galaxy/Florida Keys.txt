By the 2100's this area of Earth, an archipelago (series of islands) extending southwest off the southern tip of Florida, had become a terrible tourist trap, but by the 2150s that trend had been reversed.  The Tucker family resided in the Keys; their home was destroyed when the entire area was devastated in the 2153 Xindi attack on Earth.
