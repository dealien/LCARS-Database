QUADRANT:

Small reddish orange/brown planetoid orbiting Eris Alpha III, similar to Earth's moon. Possesses a rotation of 17.3 Earth hours. Colonized by the Anu'anshee in ancient times and then abandoned in the 7800's B.C. Answering a distress call on January 13, 2152, Enterprise NX01 discovered an outpost belonging to the Sarkassians, which had been damaged by one or more explosions within the past 24 hours. Contact with the Sarkassian Empire allowed the crew to learn that the sixty scientists working at the outpost had been killed when the Relayer Haven smashed into the base.
