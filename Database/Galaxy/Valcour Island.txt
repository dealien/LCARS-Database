LOCATION: Valcour Island

Just south of Plattsburgh, New York, Valcour Island is one of the largest islands in Lake Champlain.  On the morning of October 11, 1776 a dramatic naval battle began here in the narrow channel between the island and the mainland. A fleet of 15 vessels, commanded by Benedict Arnold and including the Sloop-of-war Enterprise, was engaged by a much larger and far superior British fleet.
