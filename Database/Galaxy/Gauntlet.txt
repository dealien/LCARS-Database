REGION: The Gauntlet
SYSTEM: Lemax
SECTOR: 221-G
QUADRANT: Alpha

A region in the Lemax system, between two warring planets in the former Thallonian Empire. The area was infamous as a battlefield, but was silent for centuries after the Thallonians ended the conflict. After the fall of the Thallonian Empire, fighting resumed almost immediately, and the Cambon, a noncombatant vessel transporting Thallonian refugees, became caught in the cross fire.
