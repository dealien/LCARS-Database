REGION: Delphic Expanse

A region of space around thirty light-years from Earth, about one thousand light-years across. Surrounded by a dense layer of thermobaric clouds that make it difficult to enter and impossible to exit, it is subject to numerous anomalies and in some parts the laws of physics do not apply. Home to fierce and dangerous species such as the Xindi. In the 2130s a Klingon ship emerged from the Expanse; its entire crew was anatomically inverted but still alive. After this incident the Klingon High Council forbade all ships from entering the Expanse. The crew of the Vulcan starship Vaankara went mad and killed each other within two days of entering the Expanse. The Enterprise NX-01 entered the Expanse in 2153 as part of its mission to stop a second Xindi attack on Earth.
