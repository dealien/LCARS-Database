CLASS: Columbus
TYPE: cruiser

This early Terran vessel design was vastly popular for its ability to travel between systems. Some of the more famous vessels of the period were of this classification, like the Icarus that made First Contact with Alpha Centauri. Though its advanced fusion engines could produce speeds up to .75c, new ships incorporating Zefram Cochrane’s warp principles soon superceded the Columbus-class for interstellar flight. The original Icarus is preserved in the Spaceflight Museum on Luna.
