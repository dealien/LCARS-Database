CLASS: Negh`Var
TYPE: heavy cruiser

The newest flagship of the Klingon fleet when it was introduced, and General Martok commanded this Klingon vessel on stardate 49011 during the invasion of Cardassia. The vessel was slowly duplicated to allow for multiple versions of the craft throughout the fleet. 
These ships have massive disruptors, photon launchers, and powerful shields, as well as a large crew compliment. These ships can also be equipped with an Ion Cannon which fires a single, powerful blast of ionized energy that decimates an enemy target.
Admiral Janeway was chased by a pair of these while she was in a shuttlecraft escaping a dishonorable Klingon that traded temporal technology with the future version of the U.S.S. Voyager commander.
