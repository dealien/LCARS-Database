SHIPS: Enterprise, I.S.S.
CLASS: Constitution
TYPE: heavy cruiser

Mirror universe counterpart to the U.S.S. Enterprise, it too was a Constitution-class heavy cruiser exploring space so that they could conquer new worlds for the Terran Empire. This ship differed from the one used in our universe in subtle ways like daggers painted on doors and henchmen guarding the corridors.
Captain James Kirk and his away party encountered the brutal parallel timeline when they were accidentally transported to the I.S.S. Enterprise during an ion storm in 2267.
