FLEET: Ktarian vessels

The Ktarians do not have a military fleet that is known of. They have designed many transports to fuel their trade and economy.
One such ship was commanded by Etana Jol. Jol was in charge of the 2368 attempt to control Starfleet via an addictive game. Her ship met up with the U.S.S. Enterprise-D near the Phoenix cluster, but when the plot failed, it was towed to Starbase 82.
