SHUTTLECRAFT: Klingon

This early design was discovered by Earth vessels before the trip by Enterprise to Qo'noS. A single Klingon pilot was caught, adrift, in this craft and taken to a space port where he was able to request additional help. This mission was conducted by a civilian transport and not reported to authorities until much after the "official" first contact with Klingons at Broken Bow, Oklahoma.
