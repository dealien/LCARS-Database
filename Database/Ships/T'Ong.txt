SHIPS: T`Ong, I.K.S.
CLASS: K'tinga

An old Klingon battle cruiser, launched in 2290, that was part of a "sleeper program" so that the Empire would have ships around in the future to continue a war, and maybe even retake the Empire is the war did not go favorably in the past. The High Council was concerned that the pre-alliance crew from over 75 years ago would awake from cryogenic sleep around stardate 42901, ready to pillage undefended Federation outposts. A Klingon cruiser was being sent to intercept the eager warriors, but was not going to make its rendezvous on time. Special emissary K'Ehleyr and Worf of the Enterprise-D helped subdue its crew without bloodshed
