FLEET: Grazerite vessels

A fleet of ships maintained by the Grazerite government for the maintenance of its sovereign rights and responsibilities. This fleet consists of a number of craft with forward sweeping wings in a crescent shape both horizontally and vertically for atmospheric capabilities provided by enhanced anti-gravity generators. In most cases the lateral wings contain the antigravity emitters and assist with atmospheric flight.
The Grazerite people still make use of anti-gravity projectors and continue to refine the technology that they developed and introduced to the Federation. This is important since all of the native starships are designed for atmospheric flight and landing; including their largest members.
Since the Grazerite have joined the United Federation of Planets they have not had the need for large cruisers, leaving defenses to the Starfleet. But they have kept up a class of light cruisers for defense of their homeland and colonies. In addition to that the Grazerite maintain several large carriers to transport commerical and military craft throughout space. Other military vessels include one destroyer class and one interceptor class ship. Commercial ships compliment the typical Grazerite spaceports, including several kinds of transports, freighters, and shuttle craft. One last distinctive ship used on the homeworld and colonies is a speeder for surface use only.
