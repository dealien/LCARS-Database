SHIPS: Daelen's vessel

A ship used by Daelen before his genome was stolen by Steth. Because of all the problems Steth caused for his victims the Benthan patrol ships tried to arrest the new host of that body, Tom Paris, and impound Daelen's ship. The U.S.S. Voyager, also caught up in the mixture, was able to help Daelen and Paris regain their original forms from Steth.
