SHIPS: Trieste, USS
CLASS: Merced

A starship too small to ferry the entire Enterprise crew out to regain their ship after it is hijacked from Starbase 74 by the Bynars, and too slow — it's 66 hours away. Data passed through an unstable wormhole while serving aboard the U.S.S. Trieste. It was one of the ships in Picard's blockade fleet on the Klingon-Romulan border in 2367.
