Starship that the U.S.S. Enterprise was to have rendezvoused with after leaving the Acamarian talks in 2366 until Starfleet postponed the order in favor of a medical resupply run to the Alpha Leonis system. It was also one of the ships in Captain Picard's blockade fleet on the Klingon-Romulan border in 2368.

This starship is the only one known of its kind, so the class, Korolev, was issued to it in recognition of spacecraft designer Sergey Pavlovich Korolev, a key figure in the early Russian space program.
