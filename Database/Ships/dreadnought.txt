TYPE: dreadnought

A dreadnought is an extra heavy cruiser used for tactical purposes.

The Cardassians also created a huge missile program for interplanetary warheads. One of these weapons was abducted by the Maquis and named “Dreadnought.” These missiles were larger than traditional fighter craft and had to be manufactured at a special facility within the Cardassian Union.
