A transport ship in use since at least the latter days of the Bajoran occupation with a capacity of at least about 100 passengers, with routes including round trips to Terok Nor. At least according to one of Garak's various reasons for his exile, he blew one up under orders to stop a handful of escaping Bajorans aboard, despite the loss of 97 Cardassian civilians plus crew, one of whom was a superior's daughter.
