SHIPS: Yangtzee Kiang, U.S.S.
CLASS: Danube
REGISTRY: NCC-72453

One of Deep Space 9's three original runabout vessels dropped off by the U.S.S. Enterprise-D. It was used by Major Kira Nerys to mount Commander Benjamin Sisko's rescue operation with Science Officer Jadzia Dax, Security Chief Odo and Doctor Julian Bashir, when it carried a special-mission module, perhaps due to its refigured navigational sensors to better handle the wormhole. The ship was crash-landed and lost in the Gamma Quadrant, after Sisko had taken it to show Kai Opaka the wormhole - and unwittingly fulfill a Bajoran prophesy - with Kira and Bashir.
