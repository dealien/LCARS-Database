FLEET: Karemma vessels

Ships of the Dominion client state featuring a sweptback symmetry, open design and fins. 
A medium cruiser was sent to meet up with the U.S.S. Defiant in 2372, carrying Hanon to covertly meet with Sisko and Quark for trade negotiations. The ship carried 23 besides himself. That ship was destroyed by the Jem'Hadar.
A transport was sent to Deep Space Nine to collect the survivors from Hanon's vessel that were rescued by the Defiant.
