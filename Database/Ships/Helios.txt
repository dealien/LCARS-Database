SHIPS: Helios

Starship. Helios was a composite of several different technologies.  It had a Klingon hull with Cardassian phaser emplacements and was equipped with a cloaking device as well as a metaphasic shield. Most of the hull was bare metal or painted in pale gray primer.  The ship had a tower rising from the center of the hull that was believed to be the bridge.  Helios's basic computer hardware was Ferengi, but the software was Federation.  Helios was a pirate ship commanded by Demaree Kolovzon and attacked at least 42 ships between 2365-70.  In 2370, the Helios was badly in need of new parts.  Though the ship was jury rigged by its chief engineer, the damage was too extensive and without new parts, the ship would soon be inoperable and so they arranged to buy new parts from smugglers aboard the Carabas.  Unfortunately, the smugglers were arrested during the rendezvous and the ship did not receive the needed parts. The Helios escaped into the Wormhole in 2370, however since the ship was severely damaged it is not known if it survived.
