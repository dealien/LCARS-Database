SHIPS: time-travel pod

A craft of the 26th century, approximately five meters in length and composed of plasticized tritanium mesh. In 2368, a 22nd century scientist - Professor Berlingoff Rasmussen - arrived on board the U.S.S. Enterprise-D in such a craft. Rasmussen claimed to be from the future, but in fact had stolen the pod from its true owner and was using it to bring technology back in time to take credit for it.

This ship was a re-dress of the Nenebek model created for "Final Mission."
