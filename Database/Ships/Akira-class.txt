CLASS: Akira
TYPE: Heavy Cruiser

The Akira was put into production in 2370 to provide offensive strength and support to Starfleet's armada. The Akira has since become an invaluable asset to Starfleet, first by helping repel the Borg offensive of 2373, and later in the Dominion War. Its extensive shielding, maneuverability, and powerful phaser banks make it useful in both offensive and defensive situations.
The U.S.S. Akira has also been the testbed for a prototype weapon system, the Chain Reaction Pulsar. This devastating weapon draws power from its initial target, then moves to the closest enemy target, drawing even more energy from it. The weapon continues to grow in power until it unleashes its accumulated force on its final target.
