SHIPS: Archon, U.S.S.
CLASS: Daedalus
REGISTRY: NCC-

An early Federation craft that vanished near the planet Beta III in 2167, when it was pulled from its orbit by the computer system Landru. The surviving crew was absorbed into Beta III's society and population, eventually becoming known as Archons. 

Reference: The Return of the Archons 
The classification as Daedalus is conjecture since it is consistent with references made to the U.S.S. Essex from the episode "Power Play."
