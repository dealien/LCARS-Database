SHUTTLECRAFT: Galileo II
TYPE: 2
REGISTRY: NCC-1701-7

One of the U.S.S. Enterprise's shuttles, a replacement for the first Galileo. 
The shuttle was used often as in the mission to escort Commissioner Nancy Hedford from planet Epsilon Canaris III to the Enterprise. That particular mission was stopped by the Companion energy creature that created an electromagnetic storm to pull the ship off course and to the Gamma Canaris region where they met up with Zefram Cochrane; marooned on an asteroid there.
The Galileo II was also used by Commander Spock to inject the giant space-borne amoeba that destroyed the Gamma 7A System.
The Galileo II was stolen by Dr. Sevrin in 2269, during his search for the mythical planet Eden.

The latter two episodes were filmed after "The Galileo Seven" in which the Galileo was destroyed at Taurus II.
