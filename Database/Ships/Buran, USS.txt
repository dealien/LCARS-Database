The Borg destroyed the Buran and 38 other starships in the battle of Wolf 359. (The Buran is pictured in the middle left of the screen)

Reference: The Best of Both Worlds
The Buran was a "kit bashed" study model barely glimpsed among the wreckage of the "graveyard" scene in the episode. The ship was named for the Russian space shuttle, which was in turn named for the Russian word for "snowstorm."
