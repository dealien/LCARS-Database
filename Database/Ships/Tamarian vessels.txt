FLEET: Tamarian vessels

Some are as large as a Galaxy-class starship. Dathon's ship was an open design with an angular, triangled head section and airplane-like "wings" with engine pods mounted on each that glow orange in exposed grillwork.

This vessel was likely reused for the model of the T’Lani cruiser (DS9) and Drayan ship (VOY).
