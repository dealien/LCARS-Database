FLEET: Skreean vessels

On Stardate 47391.2, Haneek's Skrreean transport, from the Gamma Quadrant, suffered a plasma leak in its engine core. The vessel also had overheated reactors and malfunctioning life support systems. Its four passengers were rescued by DS9's transporter. 
A large number of similar vessels followed Haneek and her family through the "Eye" into the Alpha Quadrant where they hoped to find Kentana, their prophesized new world after theirs was ravaged by invaders.
Haneek's son, Tumak, used the ship in a fatal run for Bajor; the radiation leaking from its port nacelle ignited following a brief fire fight, thus destroying ship.

Many of these ships were re-used models of other craft. Most noticeable is the reused Cleponji- Promelian battle cruiser docked at the two upper pylons. It appears that Haneek's vessel was the Norkova.
