SHUTTLECRAFT: Ramosa-class 

A small two deck utility shuttle designed for intership transit, and ship to shore transfers. While they are capable of interplanetary flight, and even interstellar flight, they are not usually used for those tasks except under military emergency. Some shuttles have been converted for scientific use by replacing the cargo deck with sensor equipment. Due to the reliability of Antedean within nebulas, Starfleet has often recruited them to assist with exploration. 
The ship is the usual teardrop shape like the rest of Antedean designs. It is equipped with four tail fins that house the engineering sections, and a bridge module that contains ship control. The warp nacelles are imbedded in the sides of the craft like all Andorian designs for protection to the nacelles in dense atmospheres.
