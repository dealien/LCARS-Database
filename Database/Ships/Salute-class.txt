CLASS: Salute
TYPE: Heavy cruiser/ carrier

Once the Federation successfully developed tetryon-based warp and began to install it into its newly designed vessels the Federation Council agreed to the establishment of new starbases and space stations across the entire Milky Way to support the Federation presence and ambassadorial functions underway in the new regions. New and larger ships were needed to carry out this work.
The Salute-class carrier was built to explore far reaching sections of the galaxy and to build a station to maintain Federation needs in the new territory. These ships are equipped with a detachable saucer and double warp nacelle design typical of all Starfleet vessels. It also features four detachable personnel hulls that connect to the secondary hull and contain the residences of up to 20,000 humanoids which are used for crewing and building new stations. The aft of the ship is equipped with a ship yard style set of girders and lights used for building large sections of a space station and repairing support fleets.
These ships are carriers not only since they can transport enormous amounts of cargo necessary for the construction of a station but also since they hold a fleet of workbees, also necessary for the construction process, and other exploratory support function craft. A wing of fighters are assigned to each cruiser to offer protection during the construction process of a station, and may be assigned to that station if command personnel deem it necessary. And a detachment of scientific support vessels are included within these carriers. Current configurations allow for up to 15 enhanced Danube-class runabouts and science dedicated shuttlecraft to operate as part of a team focusing around the work of the Salute-class central command.
