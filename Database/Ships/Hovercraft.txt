VEHICLE: Hovercraft

A name for a type of vehicle that moves shortly above the ground. Such a vehicle may be supported by forced-air, antigravity (aka repulsors) or other methods. These kinds of vehicles can not actually fly and are limited to two-dimensional movement mirroring the terrain of the ground. These kinds of vehicles are “all terrain” and can traverse land, water, and variations of those without difficulty. 
These types of vessels were used by the terrestrial Port Authority on Earth.
