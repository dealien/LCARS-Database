CLASS: Constitution
TYPE: heavy cruiser

Initially commissioned circa 2245, this type of Federation starship is one of the most well-known. During the 2250s there were only twelve of this class of ship commissioned into service. The original U.S.S. Enterprise is of this class. Others have included the U.S.S. Excalibur NCC-1664 and the U.S.S. Potemkin NCC-1657. A refit program was instituted to bring new life into the original starships as well as an aggressive program to build a variant of this class, called Constitution II-class.
