CLASS: Carrier
TYPE: carrier

This vessel was designed with the same spaceframe as the Galaxy-class with an extended saucer to make the ship considerably longer, and an added module on the front which contains a deflector dish similar to the Defiant-class that can protect the far reaching end of the saucer which was too far from the traditional deflector array of the secondary hull.
The extra space allows these vessels to carry wings of shuttles, fighters, runabouts, or other craft; considerably more than the traditional heavy cruiser.

Reference: 
The facts of this ship are conjectural.
