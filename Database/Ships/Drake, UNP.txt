PROBE: U.N.P. Drake
CLASS: Wells-series

The Drake discovered what was then unknown deformations in the space-time fabric that are fairly common in the interstellar void. These “Geon Holes” in space were harnessed forty years later for the quantum jump to warp communications.
Telemetry readout:
ATTENTION
* Anomaly indicated in density pattern of interstellar dust in surrounding region.
ANALYZING
* Drift examination shows attraction of hydrogen, helium, and other elements of focal point approximately .117 A.U. distant.
* Attraction extends outward from point in gravity-wave patterns.
* Sensors can find no mass or energy source at center point of attraction.
* Implementing course correction for closer analysis. Approach modified to maintain .05 A.U.  distance from anomaly.
ATTENTION-
* Anomaly indicated at focal point of attraction.
ANALYZING
* Interstellar dust disappearing from universe at focal point.
* Matter apparently vanished into focal point.
CONCLUSION
* Cause unknown .
* Data contrary to Prime Programming Loop “Laws of Physics.”
* All problem solving circuits output impossible series converging to 1/0, an undefined and impermissible endpoint.
* Random-access memory integration unable to locate acceptable explanation.
* Repeat data summary: interstellar dust disappearing from universe. Cause unknown.
