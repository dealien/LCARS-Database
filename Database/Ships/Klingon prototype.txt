SHIPS: Chang's bird of prey

Prior to 2293, an experimental version of the Klingon's most infamous vessel was developed to allow the firing of torpedos while cloaked. 
This prototype Bird-of-Prey was commanded by General Chang, who engaged Captain Kirk and the Enterprise-A in an effort to obstruct the Khitomer peace conference. Chang's efforts were unsuccessful, for both he and the prototype were destroyed by Enterprise and Captain Sulu on the U.S.S. Excelsior. The crew of the Enterprise used a modified torpedo, equipped with gas nebula sensors, to track down the emissions from the vessel and target it. The explosion itself was then targeted and fired upon until the ship was destroyed.
The cloaking field distorted light around the deflection area of the craft, but torpedoes fired by the ship were within the deflection screen for a few moments making the vessel visible through the cloak while the torpedo was still inside the field. Once the torpedo cleared the vessel's deflection area the ship became invisible again. This small "flaw" would only make the ship visible to the eye, not to sensors.
