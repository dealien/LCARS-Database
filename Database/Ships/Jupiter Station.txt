STATIONS: Jupiter Station

Starfleet facility orbiting the fifth planet in the Sol System. It is an enormous facility operated by Starfleet's Research & Development division and works on top secret projects and well as design work for starships, and other Federation uses. Like many Federation facilities it was well equipped with scientific and military centers as well as recreational and commercial stores. One resident, Dr. Lewis Zimmerman, offered Leeta, from Quark's bar at Deep Space 9, a position as manager of one of the station's café's.
Tuvok was stationed there for a time, through which he kept in contact with Kathryn Janeway through written letters. The station is also equipped with numerous cargo holds so that starships can be re-stocked at that station rather than continuing all the way in to Earth.
Some of the more notable projects that have come from this station include: 
The Emergency Medical Hologram by Dr. Lewis Zimmerman and Lieutenant Reginald Barclay.
The first phase cannons, as used aboard NX-class vessels.
