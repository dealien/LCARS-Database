SHIPS: Shannar

Azhaeri ship that runs a shipping route through the Bajoran sector about every six weeks.  The ship's captain was a Farruna named Radath Keiy. When docking in 2370, the Shannar arrived at Deep Space Nine according to its flight plan; the first time that happened since Odo's been on the station.
