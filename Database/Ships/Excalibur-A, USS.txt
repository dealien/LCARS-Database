SHIPS: U.S.S. Excalibur 
CLASS: Galaxy
TYPE: heavy cruiser
REGISTRY: NCC-26517-A

McKenzie Calhoun was assigned as captain of this vessel for its first mission. It was then assigned to replace its predecessor to observe the activity in Sector 221-G after the collapse of the former Thallonian Empire. It took up duty next to the U.S.S. Titan where many of the crew of the former Excalibur transferred to and whose commander, Captain Elizabeth Shelby, was married to the commander of the Excalibur.

The designation of this ship as a –A is contradictory to the starship registry policy accepted by Paramount and created by Michael Okuda. Other starships that use hyphenated registries include the Enterprise which was accepted by the policy as the only allowable exception to the rule because it was the flagship of the fleet; and the U.S.S. Yamato which was corrected in a subsequent episode of TNG.
