SHIPS: Phoenix
CLASS: Titan

Zefram Cochrane and Lily Sloane built this prototype spaceship from an old Titan-V nuclear missile. The Phoenix was the first craft launched from Earth to travel faster than the speed of light, utilizing warp drive technology. It's 2063 voyage was responsible for Earth's first contact with extraterrestrials. The rocket was made available after being stripped of it warheads during World War III. The Phoenix was placed on display at the Smithsonian Institute, and was the subject of a course at the Starfleet Academy.
It was learned in 2372 that the Borg invaded Earth space and sent a temporal sphere into earth's past in an attempt to stop First Contact. After firing several blasts at the Montana missile complex, the rocket was damaged. Engineering teams from the U.S.S. Enterprise-E which followed the sphere back in time, were sent to the staging area in period clothing, to affect repairs to the rocket in an effort to restore the timeline to its original course.

Reference: First Contact 
The ship was named for the immortal bird from Egyptian mythology that periodically was consumed in fire, then arose from the ashes reborn. The Phoenix was designed by Herman Zimmerman and John Eaves, loosely based on a conjectural model created by Greg Jein.
