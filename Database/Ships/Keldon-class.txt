CLASS: Keldon
TYPE: Heavy cruiser

A new variation of the Galor-class warship designed and maintained by the Obsidian order; despite their charter limitations that prevent them from operating military vessels. These new craft were originally built at secret shipyards in the Orias System. News of the event made its way to the Central Command when Lieutenant Thomas Riker stole the U.S.S. Defiant from Deep Space Nine in an attempt to destroy the yards. When Riker made his way to the system three of these classification of craft began pursuit of his ship until he was rescued by a Cardassian patrol under the command of Gul Dukat, who wanted an explanation for the secret weapons.
These ships were larger than the regular version Galor-class, equipped with a large section the size of a freighter onto its dorsal tail. These ships were faster than the others in the fleet as well. Later it becomes known that the ships were being modified with Romulan cloaking devices for the ill-fated attack on the Founders homeworld.
