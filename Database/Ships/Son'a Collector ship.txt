SHIPS: Son`a collector ship

Son'a vessel created specifically to collect life-giving metaphasic radiation particles from the Ba'ku homeworld in 2375.  It was destroyed by the U.S.S. Enterprise-E. It worked by deploying a a craft into the radiation field that would cause a chemical reaction, forcing the metaphasic properties to condense and "fall" from orbit. The enormous collection sails on the ship would funnel the particles into the ship for storage and later processing. 
This huge ship was equipped with sail like collectors that had to be deployed from a storage hangar when the ship was in transit. The craft was controlled by remote from the Son'a flagship but had primary controllers on board the craft as well. Remote operation was necessary since the intense radiation from the reactions would likely be fatal to humanoids.
The ship was designed to perform its operations within three-minute time frame. At one minute the interior of the craft would be filled with gas discharges from the readying module that would soon launch from the nose of the craft. This gas could easily be ignited by weapons fire and could cause severe damage to the collector and all persons in the area.
