SHUTTLECRAFT: Toron-class
TYPE:

A small, Klingon shuttle. After the Praxis incident the Klingon government released this model to other governments for use in their fleets. The Klingon government needed a way to increase revenues into their economy while they worked on cleaning up their atmosphere.
Koral's shuttlecraft, which received a safety inspection on the Enterprise-D, was of the Toron-class. 

Reference: Gambit
This model was used many times throughout the various series and explains the conjectural statement that the Klingons sold the design.
