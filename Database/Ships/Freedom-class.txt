CLASS: Freedom

U.S.S. Freedom, NX-
U.S.S. Firebrand, NCC-68723

A Starfleet vessel

Reference: The Best of Both Worlds
The Firebrand was one of the ships in the graveyard scene after the Borg attack on Wolf 359. At the time of writing this entry I can't reall if it was actually seen, or if it was mentioned on a display screen aboard the Enterprise-D.
