SHIPS: Victory, H.M.S.

Ancient British sailing ship. The H.M.S. Victory was Lord Horatio Nelson's (1758-1805) flagship during the Battle of Trafalgar, in which he was killed. Geordi La Forge built a large model of the oceangoing vessel as a gift for Starship Victory Captain Zimbata. Prior to the Borg encounter of 2366-67, Captain Jean-Luc Picard drew inspiration from Nelson's courage at Trafalgar.

The model still graces the late Gene Roddenberry's office in the home of his widow, Majel Barret Roddenberry.
