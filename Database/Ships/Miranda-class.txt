SHIP CLASS: Miranda
TYPE: medium cruiser

The first starship of its class and the beginning of a new breed of medium-cruiser. This starship was occasionally equipped with a sensor "roll bar" to assist in its work as an exploration craft. This particular piece of equipment did not operate reliably in the beginning so other vessels of this class took a lesson from the prototype and some were not outfitted with it. 
The Miranda also tested several other design improvements, not all of which were used on subsequent models, or were enhanced even more for other variations of this class of starship.
Some variations did include port and starboard mounted sensor dishes; and others were fitted with heavy weapon systems and assigned to patrol duties; these were later known as Soyuz-class ships like the U.S.S. Brattain.
This was the first class of starship that Kathryn Janeway visited. She was nine years old, and went to see her father.
