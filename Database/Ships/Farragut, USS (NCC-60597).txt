SHIPS: Farragut, U.S.S.

Dr. Bashir's friends Sarina, Patrick, Jack and Lauren used this Excelsior-class Federation ship to travel to Deep Space Nine. 

Reference: Chrysalis
I don't accept a word of this entry. It has a larger number than the Nebula-class version which would indicate that it was built after but Excelsior-class ships are an older design and likely stopped being built by the time Nebulas came into use. And the registry numbers are VERY close, 60591 and 60597.
