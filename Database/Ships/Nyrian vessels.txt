FLEET: Nyrian vessels

This race uses machines stolen from other species in its fleet and has only one type of craft that it has designed. The Nyrians used this large vessel to abduct various alien races and steal other ships and space stations. Their ship contained many different biospheres, interconnected by disguised portals and a web of access tunnels. When the crew of Voyager was abducted, Captain Janeway managed to outwit the Nyrians and return the prisoners to their respective homeworlds.
