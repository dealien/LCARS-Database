STATIONS: Fluidic Gate

An organic space station in use by Species 8472 to travel between their space and our space without the presence of a quantum string filament. These gates evolve from passive embryos produced by the mothership. They are able to locate and transfer large starships from within Fluidic space and bring them locally, including large ships like the Behemoth-class.
