SHIPS: Assan’s ship

One of the vessels participating in the Antarian Trans-Stellar Rally in the Delta Quadrant in 2377. Assan, an Imhotep species, piloted his vessel ruthlessly by "scraping," grazing the shields of competitors to damage their vessels or send them off-course. This ship won the rally.
