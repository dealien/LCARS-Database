SHIPS: Trumbull

A galley in the United States Continental Navy in October, 1776.  The fleet was under the command of General Benedict Arnold, and consisted of three schooners, four galleys, eight fifty-four foot gondalas, and a sloop-of-war (the Enterprise), sixteen ships in all.  On October 11, along with the rest of the fleet, clashed with the British Royal Navy at Valcour Island.  The Continental Navy fought valiantly, but late that evening found themselves in a perilous position.  Unable to fight the British fleet further, the Continental fleet chose to retreat under the cover of a heavy fog which flowed into the bay late that evening.  The Trumbull led the single file line of quietly fleeing ships out of the bay past the unsuspecting British ships.  {Although they were successful in escaping that night, historical accounts show that the British Navy later caught up with them, forcing a second bloody confrontation.  Many ships were lost, but the Trumbull (along with the Enterprise and two other Continental ships) survived.
