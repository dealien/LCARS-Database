CLASS: D'deridex "Warbird"
TYPE: Heavy Cruiser

Designation for a massive Romulan spacecraft. Considered to be the flagship of the Empirical fleet. These ships, significantly larger than a Galaxy-class starship, are belived to have greater firewpoer, but a slightly lower sustainable warp speed. Starfleet at one time designated these ships as B-Type Warbirds.
These ships are also equipped with cloaking devices that make them very hard to detect until battle, but the ship must decloak to fire any weapons.
In 2374 the Romulans began to employ an experimental technology to these ships, a shield inversion beam. This beam drains an enemy's shields directly from the ship and transfers them to te warbird's defense.
