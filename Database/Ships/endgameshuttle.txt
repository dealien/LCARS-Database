SHUTTLECRAFT: 
TYPE:
MODEL:
MISSION: 

An advanced small personal craft used by individuals or small teams to transport between ships, stations, planets within a system, or from a vessel to planet when transporters are not appropriate. This version included many technological advancements derived from lessons learned by the U.S.S. Voyager and feature Borg-inspired defenses.
In the future, ten years after Voyager's return to the Alpha Quadrant, this shuttle served as primary transport for Admiral Kathryn Janeway, the SC4. 
Admiral Janeway took her shuttle to a moon, where she met Miral Paris. Miral introduced Janeway to Koroth, of the House of Koroth. Koroth possesed a chrono-deflector for the admiral, but refused to give it to her when Janeway refused to provide him with information regarding her shuttle's shield modifications.
After Janeway took the deflector, Koroth sent his ship to intercept Janeway's shuttle. Prior to the skirmish, Janeway deployed her shuttle's new armor technology. This technology is capable of absorbing the brunt of any phaser blast.
After fixing the chrono-deflector to her shuttle's hull, Janeway took her shuttle back in time, to aid Voyager in one last encounter with the Borg.
