STATIONS: Quantum Research

A Cardassian research station devoted to developing a gateway into Fluidic space through which Species 8472 vessels could be pulled into our space and used in a fight. While the alien ships were vastly superior to local vessels they could not be controlled and often took aim on the Cardassian ships too. Once the technology was developed a new weapon was added to Kulinor-class starships that could open the fluidic gate.
