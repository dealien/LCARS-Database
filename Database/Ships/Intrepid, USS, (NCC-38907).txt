SHIPS: Intrepid, U.S.S.
CLASS: Excelsior
REGISTRY: NCC-38907

This starship was the assigned post of Sergey Rozhenko as a chief petty officer and warp-field specialist, and Commander Donald Kaplan and the chief engineer. As a crewman aboard the craft, Rozhenko was at the scene of Khitomer and rescued an orphaned Klingon child and raised him on Earth. He later grew up to be Worf, the first Klingon in Starfleet, and which served aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise-D, U.S.S. Enterprise-E, and Deep Space Nine.

Timeline:
2346: This starship was the first vessel, Federation or Klingon, to respond to the distress call of the Khitomer outpost following the Romulan attack.

In 2375, while infiltrating Species 8472's Terrasphere 8 in the Delta Quadrant, Commander Chakotay of the U.S.S. Voyager claimed to have just arrived from a three-year tour on the Intrepid. The creature posing as groundskeeper Boothby noted that the Intrepid was patrolling the Romulan Neutral Zone at the time. This, though, was a contrived scenario in 8472's training simulation of the Federation.
