SHIPS: Cambon

A freighter ship piloted by a man named Hufmin. The Cambon’s comfortable passenger complement was 29, but when it was rescued by the U.S.S. Excalibur it was carrying 47 refugee passengers. He normally hauled cargo but decided to make money ferrying terrified residents of former Thallonian cities to safe harbour. He found that his personal goals were quickly outwitted by his sensitivity when he overloaded his craft with people and began accepting discounted fares from those less fortunate, even some free passages. In an attempt to save some money he attempted a short cut through The Gauntlet just as the two warring sides of that area of space began a heated battle. The Cambon was caught in the middle of the firefight, hit multiple times, and left spiraling out of control. A distress call attracted the attention of the Federation starship which rescued the passengers and its captain. Lieutenant Commander Burgoyne 172 led a team from hir engineering staff over to the craft to affect repairs.
The transport was divided into three sections; the helm pit, the midsection, which contained equipment storage and the captain’s private quarters, aft cargo hold.
