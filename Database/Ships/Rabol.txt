SHIPS: Rabol
TYPE: transport

Cardassian transport which ferried Gul Dukat to Deep Space Nine for the Ravinok hunt with Major Kira Nerys.

Reference: Indiscretion 
The Continuum source described Dukat as "Legate" but as editor I changed the term back to the one used by the Encyclopedia since I personally cannot recall Dukat ever being given the other title.
