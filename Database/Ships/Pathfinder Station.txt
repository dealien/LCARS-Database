STATIONS: Starfleet Communications

This Earth-based high-rise building developed the Pathfinder Project which created a tachyon beam and aimed it at an itinerant pulsar and created an artificial wormhole which allowed for instant communication between the U.S.S. Voyager and Starfleet. Lieutenant Reginald Barclay was assigned to the station and developed the project. He worked with Admiral Paris and Commander Peter Harkins. This facility maintained the operational controls to the Midas Array in orbit.
