SHIPS: Klothos, I.K.S.
CLASS: D-7
TYPE: heavy cruiser

Klingon cruiser. Kor commanded this ship during the Klingon victory over the Federation at Caleb IV. 

Reference: Once More Unto the Breach 
The assumption of a D-7 class is based on the fact that it was the same kind of cruiser used by Kang and Koloth during their years of power. It is, however, conjectural.
