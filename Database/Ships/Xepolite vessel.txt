SHIPS: Xepolite Free Traders
TYPE: transports

Merchant ships used by the non-aligned Xepolites, geared more to stealth and escape rather than fighting. With a top speed of warp 9.8, the one stopped by Commander Benjamin Sisko and Gul Dukat in a runabout had a hull composed of sensor reflective material which masked to sensors its hull full of illegal Cardassian weapons bound for the Demilitarized Zone.
