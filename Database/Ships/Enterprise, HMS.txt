A three-masted 19th century sailing frigate.
The Enterprise-D played host to a holodeck for a simulation used in Worf's promotion to lieutenant commander ceremony in 2371. The ship was also seen aboard many of the Starship Enterprises in respect to ships of similar name before them, like on the recreation deck of the refitted Constitution-class and in the captain's office aboard the NX-class vessel.
