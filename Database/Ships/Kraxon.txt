SHIPS: Kraxon
CLASS: Galor 

Commanded by Gul Ranor, and part of the Second Order, commanded by Gul Dukat. It was the first to detect the leaking neutrino trail of the cloaked U.S.S. Defiant, under the stolen command of Thomas Riker, but couldn't close with it during a pursuit to Orias III. It extended shields around the surrendering Defiant when Riker agreed to surrender to the military ships and hand over the sensor logs on the Obsidian Order's secret Orias base. 

Reference: Defiant 
The images of the starship indicate that it was actually a Keldon-class- a type of vessel secretly created at the shipyards that were JUST discovered in this episode. It appears to be a contradiction.
