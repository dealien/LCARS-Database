CLASS: Cabot
TYPE: transport

The ships of this class functioned as a portable refinery, traveling among remote star systems and bases to process a wide range of raw materials, from ore to oil, diamonds to dilithium. With low-warp capability and itineraries extending to the furthest reaches of the known galaxy, the crews of these trawlers would not see home for up to a decade at a time.
