CLASS: Fek'lhr
TYPE: medium cruiser

A variant of the Vor'cha-class, this vessel is equipped with a larger command section than the original. But since it was built after the original, and while larger Negh'Var's were also in production, this design was dubbed a medium cruiser and allotted to fleet deployments and frigate service. It was named after the mythical Klingon beast and Guardian of Gre'Thor, the Klingon afterlife for the dishonored. 
The Fek'lhr is equipped with powerful disruptors, photon torpedo launchers, and other typical Klingon weapons. These ships have space to be equipped with additional weapons: Death Chant, Ion Storm, Energy Dissipators, and Repulsion Waves.
