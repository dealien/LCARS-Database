SHIP TYPE: Runabout

Reference: Warchild, Time’s Enemy 
Chief O’Brien does a lot of complaining about the Cardassian equipment in the runabout.  However, runabouts are Federation property.  Unless he installed Cardassian equipment into a Federation vehicle, but there should be no reason to do that.  Therefore, O'Brien's complaints about the runabouts not functioning properly are unfounded.}
