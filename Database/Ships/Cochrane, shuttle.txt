SHUTTLECRAFT: Cochrane
TYPE: 9
REGISTRY: NCC-74656-

This shuttlecraft, attached to the U.S.S. Voyager as its Shuttlecraft 4. It can cover 50 million kilometers in 4.5 minutes and project a dekyon beam. 
In 2372 the craft, under the command of Lieutenant Thomas Paris was used to break the Warp 10 barrier in the Delta Quadrant. It was retrieved safely after the test.
The Cochrane was destroyed in early 2374 by the Cataati. Paris and B'Elanna Torres used the shuttlecraft to retrieve Voyager's ejected warp core, but the Cataati attempted to salvage the part for themselves, and bombarded the Cochrane with an antimatter pulse. Paris and Torres escaped the shuttle's destruction by donning environmental suits and beaming themselves into space. 

Named for the discoverer of warp drive, Zefram Cochrane.
