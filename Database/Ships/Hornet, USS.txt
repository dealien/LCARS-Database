CLASS: Renaissance
REGISTRY: NCC-45231

One of the 23 ships in Picard's armada blockading Romulans trying to support the Duras faction in the Klingon civil war. To allow a hole in the tachyon sensor net, it was supposed to drop back in a ruse with the Hornet and the supposedly crippled Excalibur. 

Reference: Redemption
The Hornet was named for an American aircraft carrier that fought at the Battle of Midway in World War II. Years later, another ship with that name was the recovery vessel for the Apollo 11 moon landing mission.
