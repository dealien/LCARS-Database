STATIONS: Ty'Gokor

A planet within an unspecified asteroid field deep in Klingon space, the most heavily fortified installation in the Empire. After Gowron moved his military headquarters there following his attack on the UFP in early 2373 over the Archanis Sector, Sisko covertly infiltrated it to prove whether Gowron is a Changeling. At least 30 warships are stationed there and the entire asteroid belt is protected by a tachyon detection grid against cloaking.
