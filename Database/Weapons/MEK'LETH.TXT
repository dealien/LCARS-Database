WEAPONS: Mek'leth

A Klingon sword approximately half as long as the bat'leth. It is equipped with one long and one short blade, and a single grip. Mek'leth fabrication is from baakonite, like the bat'leth, though some units have been successfully made from dikeiferate, which has a density 1.18 times that of baakonite. As in most weapons designed for rapid, highly controlled maneuvers, a critical balance must be maintained between the overall mass required for striking inertia and the ability to move that mass by the person wielding it.
