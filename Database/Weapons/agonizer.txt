WEAPONS: agonizer

Small device worn by each crew member on the I.S.S. Enterprise in the mirror universe. The agonizer was used for punishment and was extremely painful. Agonizers were still in use in the mirror universe in 2372. Klingons have been known to use similar devices for discipline, as did the mercenary captain Arctus Baran.
