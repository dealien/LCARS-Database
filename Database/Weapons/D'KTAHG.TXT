WEAPONS: d'k tagh

Traditional Klingon warrior's knife. A vicious, three-bladed weapon with a spiked-ball handle tip, the d'ktahg is commonly used in hand-to-hand combat, and has great ceremonial value in Klingon rituals. It is one of the most prevalent weapons carried by a warrior besides his pistol.
At least four variations of the dagger have existed in the Klingon arsenal over the past century. Two tpyes of d'ktagh have included articulated side blades and fit within a narrow sheath, and two have been constructed with fixed blades, housed within a somehwat wider sheath.
D'ktagh are fabricated from two alloys: urs'ga rakch, a dark metallic compound that strengthens with age and is used to form the handle; and kar'kethet, naturally malleable alloy that converts to a single inelastic metal crystal with the application of 6,590 degrees Celcius for seventy-two hours.

The Continuum spelled this item wrong, spelled it as d'k tahg by mistake. The Klingon knife, first used to kill David Marcus in The Search for Spock, was designed by Phil Norwood. When the prop was to be used in The Next Generation the original was not available so Rick Sternbach duplicated the design for the show's prop makers using a Star Trek trading card for reference.
