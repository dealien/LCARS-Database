WEAPONS: shield disruptor

This weapon can be attached to Nebula-class cruisers for use in heavy battle situations and was adapted from the Breen shield dampening system used during the Dominion War. When used it disables the shields of a close group of enemy targets allowing other weapons fire to impact without interference.
