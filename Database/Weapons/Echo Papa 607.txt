WEAPONS: Echo Papa 607

An automated weapons drone system created by the now-dead arms merchants of planet Minos, built for use during the ancient Erselrope Wars. Billed by the Minosians as the ultimate in weapons system technology, the Echo Papa 607 was a small free-flying unit with a powerful energy projector and a cloaking device. The 607 was designed to be effective against ground personnel as well as deep-space vehicles, and could also be programmed for information gathering. Most significantly, the 607 embodied dynamic adaptive design, enabling it to learn during combat situations so that mistakes would not be repeated. 
An ancient Echo Papa 607 system was still active on Minos in 2364, when the Ennterprise-D investigated the dissapearance of the U.S.S. Drake there. The weapon, apparently also responsible for the destruction of the U.S.S. Drake, threatened the Enterprise and an away team on the planet's surface.

The miniature of the Echo Papa 607 was built by visual efects supervisor Dan Curry, using an old L'Eggs pantyhose container and a discarded shampoo bottle.
