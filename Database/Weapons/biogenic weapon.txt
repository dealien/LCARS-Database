WEAPONS: biogenic

Banned biological weapon constructed from biomimetic gel, retroviral vaccines, isomiotic hypos, and plasma flares. A Maquis report in 2370 of Cardassian stockpiling of these items led to a covert mission in which Jean-Luc Picard was captured and subsequently "interrogated" by the Cardassians. Cobalt diselenide is one form of this weapon.
