RECREATION: recreation deck

A large room set aside for the recreation of the crew of larger starships. The larger the vessel the larger and more numerous these rooms were. In some newer vessels these generic spaces may have been replaced with holodecks, gymnasiums, officer and other lounges, and similar spaces.
A facility like this was located aft on deck 7 of the U.S.S. Enterprise NCC-1701 after its refit. It offered an assortment of games to crewmen. Also among its features were a large viewscreen and a historical displays of past vessels named Enterprise.
