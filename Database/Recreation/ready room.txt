RECREATION: ready room

A room on many Federation vessels that is adjacent to the bridge, where the captain can work relatively undisturbed; essentially the Captain's private office.
Captain Picard's ready room on the U.S.S. Enterprise-D had a desk, a desktop viewer, a couch, and a food replicator terminal. Decorations in this room included a model of the U.S.S. Stargazer, a harbound illustrated edition of the collected works of William Shakespeare, a painting of the starship by Andrew Probert and Rick Sternbach, a saltwater aquarium containing Livingston- a fish, a crystalline sailing ship model by Hawaii artist Anthony Vanatta, an ancient nautical sextant, and in later episodes a Kurlan naiskos statuette.
