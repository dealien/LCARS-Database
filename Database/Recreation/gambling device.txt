RECREATION: gambling device

Spherical game mechanism of unknown origin, a game of chance that many players found irresistible. Martus Mazur obtained such a device in 2370  from a person named Cos. He replicated larger versions of the hadheld unit he was originally given and created a casino with them, Club Martus. It was not until later that Martus realized that the device actually altered the laws of probability, initially bringing him good fortunes, but later causing bad and even dangerous occurances, forcing Deep Space Nine personnel to destroy the devices.
