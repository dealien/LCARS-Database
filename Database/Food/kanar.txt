Kanar is a legendary dark-brown Cardassian drink that has, from time to time, aslo turned up as purple on some of the episodes. Although it's not necessaily carbonated, the closest look you can achieve is with a deep-colored chocolate syrup in sparkling soda. It's official name is "plain chocolate soda," different from an East Coast "chocolate egg cream" in that it has no white foamy head and is darker because it has no milk. The darker the chocolate syrup the better. Bosco and Fox's are the deepst in color, but you can also use Hershey'' with some coffee extract to darken the drink. For purple kanar, just use Welch's grape juice with a base of Gatorade's Riptide Rush.
