FOOD: Humat

A podlike edible plant used in the broth of a complex dish developed by Dr. Gideon Seyetik over several years. Six minced pods are used. 
Six minced Humat pods are mixed with one liter of clear Rumall stock, a tumbler and a half of Gremish, two clusters of Vulcan redspice, and a dash of ice salt. Then it's reduced in an Andorian boiler at exactly 500 degrees Kelvin, and peppered to taste. It took years for Dr. Seyetik to perfect the recipe.
