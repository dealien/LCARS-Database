FOOD: Vak clover soup

A dish Quark first served Fallit Kot during a full-couse meal in order to mollify a just-received death threat. 
Neelix- "This is another specialty at Quark's. In place of Vak clover you can use basic watercress, for a spicy bite, laced with cream. It's also a great way to start a meal that includes either Augergine or Kohlanese stew.
16 ounces clear chicken broth
2 bunches fresh watercress, chopped
1/2 cup milk
1 egg yolk, slightly beaten
3 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
salt and pepper to taste
parsley, for garnish
After you've washed and chopped your watercress, saute it for 2 minutes in 1 tablespoon butter to soften it; then add the stock, bring it to a boil, reduce it to a low boil, and cook for 5 minutes. In a separate saucepan combine the remaining butter and the flour, and cook gently until the mixture is thick and smooth. Combine with watercress and stock, add salt and pepper, and simmer for about 5 minutes. Next add the milk, stir through. Finally remove 2 tablespoons of the hot mixture, beat in egg yolk, and then stir back in. Serve immediately, sprinkled with a bit of parsley. Serves 4.
