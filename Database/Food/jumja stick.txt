FOOD: jumja stick

A Vitamin C-filled confection made of Bajoran jumja sap, molded and sold on stick by kiosk vendors on the Promenade in a roughly pyramid-shaped form resembling an old-style Terran popsicle and initially dubbed "glop on a stick." The treat was once included among Bashir's prescription for Kira's stress ond overwork. Jake got one for himself and Kira when affected by Lwaxana's Zanthi fever in 2371; O'Brien enjoyed them but Keiko hadn't the sweet tooth.
