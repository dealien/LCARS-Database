FOOD: hot dogs

A meat by-product food served in long cylinders and in a bun, often complimented with ketchup, mustard, relish, onions, cheese, chili, and/or saurkraut. 
Quark prepared Terran hot dogs for Captain Benjamin Sisko's baseball holo-programs, but Major Kira Nerys was unaware of the Terran snack. Captain Kasidy Yates offered to get some to watch Jake Sisko's new baseball holoprogram from Nog. Commander Tuvok and Lieutenant Tom Paris shared "foot longs" with Rain Robinson for breakfast in 1996 Los Angeles.
