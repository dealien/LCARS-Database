FOOD: Asparagus with Hollandaise Sauce

Asparagus is the captain's most favorite food in the whole universe, she once told me when those awful body-snatching fiends were chasing us through the ship and stole my lungs. I've learned to be a big asparagus fan myself, especially when they're steamed or stir-fried with scallions in ginger and soy sauce. Captain Janeway likes her asparagus plain, however, even though I surprise her by always including hollandaise sauce on the menu. But I never pour it over the asparagus. I serve it on the side instead. For a quick and easy Voyager-style blender hollandaise, combine in your blender the following ingredients:

3 egg yolk, carefully separated from the white 
(If you try to make this with any egg white, you get meringue)
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 teaspoon Louisiana-style hot sauce
1 dash cayenne pepper
salt to taste
1/2 pound (2 sticks) butter

Combine all of these ingredients, except the butter, in the blender and let them sit while you heat 2 sticks of butter (1/2 pound) in a medium saucepan until they are fully melted. You can also microwave the butter a half stick at a time and keep it on low heat, taking care that you don't scorch the butter. Now blend the ingredients that are in the blender for a few seconds. Pour the heated butter over the mixture in your blender and then quickly blend for another second. You're ready to serve the sauce on your freshly steamed asparagus. Yields approximately 1 1/2 cups of sauce.
