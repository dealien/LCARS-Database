FOOD: green putillos, whole

Vegetable from planet Napinne in the Delta Quadrant, which the U.S.S. Voyager brought on board to help replenish Neelix's food stores (along with Varmeliate fiber and schplict). Though they passed biofilter examinations, the whole green putillos were tested as a possible contamination source for the bioneural gel pack infection in 2371.
