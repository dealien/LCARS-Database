FOOD: Peach Cobbler

Captain Picard was a big peach cobbler fan, as is Commander Sisko. Picard's peach cobbler was prepared for him by the image of Anna. I suspect that Sisko learned to appreciate his peach cobbler from his father, whose Sisko's creole restaurant in the French Quarter of New Orleans served a peach cobbler that made even grown men cry.
The way I whip up cobblers is my galley is with any basic biscuit dough recipe. The easiest one is probably found right on the Bisquick package. Follow it to make the dough and then set it aside. Grease a shallow 9-inch square baking pan lightly with butter and preheat your oven to 425 degrees. Then place half the dough into the baking pan filling the bottom and prepare your peach filling.

2 cups peeled and sliced peaches
1/3 cup light brown sugar
2 teaspoons cinnamon
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 teaspoons granulated sugar

Heat the peaches in their own juices in a medium-sized saucepan over medium heat until they just begin to soften and bubble; add the sugar, cinnamon, and vanilla, and continue to heat. Pour the peach filling into your biscuit-dough shell, cut remaining half of the dough into 1-inch strips, and cover it. Quickly dust with granulated sugar. Bake for a 1/2 hour and serve hot, with ice cream or heavy cream on top if you wish.
