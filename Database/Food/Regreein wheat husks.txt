FOOD: Regrean wheat husks

A grain commodity (pronounced "reh-GREE-un") which Hetman Drofo Awa claims his Xepolite free trader is carrying - 5,000 tons worth. It's was a safe bet since his hull reflects sensor scans, but Gul Dukat browbeat him into admission that he was carrying arms. 
This grain has occassionally been mispelled as Regreein.
