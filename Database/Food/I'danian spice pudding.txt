FOOD: I'danian spice pudding

The sweet delicacy, extremely rich, white with a creme on top, is a favorite of Jake Sisko. Disappointed with the varieties he found on Earth during the trip back to get the Defiant, it's one of the first things Jake has upon returning home to the station in 2371. It has also been enjoyed by Bashir at the Replimat, after Garak's recovery .Quark offered a double-whipped version to Dax and Kira when he reopened after getting his own replicators on-line, but only Dax took him up on the treat.
