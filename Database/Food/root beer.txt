FOOD: root beer

A sweet and bubbly dark brown drink long popular n Earth, especially among children. Both Quark and Garak can agree it's vile: bubbly and cloying and happy, like its inventors. Quark says what's worse is that it grows on you, but despairs when it becomes a favorite of nephew Nog's. Eventually he adds it to the file in the bar's Replicator.
