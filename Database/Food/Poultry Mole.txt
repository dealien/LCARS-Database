FOOD: Poultry Mole

Here is an adaptation of a Native American sauce so easy to prepare for turkey or chicken leftovers that even Neelix can whip it together. It's hot, though, because it's made with two bottles of red chili powder, so I suggest you complement it with either a mild polenta or cornmeal side dish or rice. Makes a great meal you can cook in a skillet over an open fire at the campsite or in your own backyard.

6 cups boiling water
2 4-ounce bottles Eagle Brand red chili powder or 1 cup any good red chili powder (use less to taste)
1 1/2 pounds chicken or turkey leftovers
1/4 cup all purpose flour
2 tablespoons corn oil
2 tablespoons whole or ground cumin seed
1 teaspoon hot chili oil

If you can't find Eagle Brand in your stores, you can substitute 8 ounces (1 cuP0 of any good Mexican chili powder. Add the chili powder to the boiling water in a medium-sized saucepan and stir until you have a thick red chili sauce. Keep stirring to smooth out any lumps.
Heat corn oil in large, deep skillet, and add the chili oil and stir. Add flour and stir until it's smooth; then add the ground or whole cumin, making sure the if you use whole cumin seed, you brise the see by rubbing it between your fingers. Stir, add the chili sauce, and keep stirring for about 15 minutes.
Serve with polenta, fried cornmeal, or rice. Serves four.
