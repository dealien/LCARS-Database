FOOD: Aldebaran whiskey

The potent, green-colored alcohol is privately stocked by Quark on DS9, who found a stolen bottle in Rom's messy quarters. Scotty received a bottle of it from Data in Guinan's Ten-Forward on the Enterprise-D. 

Reference: Prophet Motive 
The whiskey at Quark's, and at Guinan's, too, for that matter, are usually quite dark, though not as dark as a brandy. Aldebaran whiskey is green, and I would use the dark green lemon-lime flavor of Gatorade called, oddly enough, Whitewater Splash. If you want to make it sparkle, cut it with a little sparkling water or Welch's white grape juice.
