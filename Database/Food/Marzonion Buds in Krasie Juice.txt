FOOD: Marzonion Buds in Krasie Juice

When the three moons align on the planet Eromt-Sew, the Marzonion plant springs forth with large beautiful buds. these buds are most delectable when boiled with the juice from the krasie tree. But at last, you can only enjoy the sublime taste or artichokes in white wine. The following recipe is a per person set of instructions, multiply it for the number of servings you wish to create.
1 artichoke
1/4 teaspoon olive oil
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 clove garlic, minced
1 cup Chablis, or 1/2 cup wine, and 1/2 cup water
First, cutt off the artichoke stems so the base is flat and the artichokes can sit on the bottom of the pot without falling over. Next, rinse the artichokes thoroughly in cold tap water. Slice off 1/2 inch from the top to remove sharp ends and open the bud. Next, discard the small leaves around the base.
In a mixing bowl, combine the oil, salt, garlic, and wine (and water if diluted). Then place the artichoke on the bottom of a large, deep saucepan, making sure that each one sits on the bottom of the saucepan and that they all fit comfortably. Pour the wine mixture over the artichokes. Cover and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to a gentle boil and cook for about 30 to 40 minutes or until a leaf from the center of the artichoke pulls out easily. This is your test for doneness.
Serve the artichokes in their won bowl. Pour the cooking liquid into a separate bowl. This is for dipping the leaves. Add another bow for discarding the uneaten portion of the leaves.
