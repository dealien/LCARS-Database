FOOD: Takarian mead

A beverage stored in kegs, stocked by Quark's. He once asked Nog to bring up five kegs. 

Reference:
Mead is a honey-colored foamy drink that is easy to make with lemonade, especially from lemonade mixes, sparkling water, and the nonalcoholic "Mr. Frothee" fizz mix you can get from any liquor store. By adding cans of frozen lemonade concentrate to the lemonade, you'll get a thicker drink that looks more like mead than like lemonade.
