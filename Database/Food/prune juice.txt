FOOD: prune juice

The liquid of a dried Earth plum, a traditional treatment for constipation but one that is new to Worf when Guinan presented it in 2366. Impressed, he christened it a "warrior's drink". Worf's parents later told Guinan they never served him prune juice because Worf never wanted anything but Klingon food. He still enjoys them on DS9, ordering at Quark's before going on the Defiant mission that led to his extradition hearing. 
The harsh taste and equally harsh reaction to prune juice prompted Worf to declare it a "warrior's drink" that readies the body for battle. I wouldn't dispute Worf on this, because I can see why, after a night of blood pies and bloodwine he'd want his prune juice the next day.
If you want to try some prune juice in a cocktail, here's what I'd recommend. Start out with 1/2 glass of prune juice and 1/2 pink grapefruit juice over ice. It's a great morning pick-me-up that does the job after a night of heavy eating on the holodeck.
