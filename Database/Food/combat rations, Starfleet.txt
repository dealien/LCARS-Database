FOOD: ration packs

Packaged in small hand-held packets, the food unit contains a timed released formula of all the nutrients the body needs for three days. These vacuum packed meals did not need refrigeration and were sealed into pillow like packages making them easy to store for long term saving. They were often included in military emergency survival kits as well for field uses since they were easier to transport and distribute than open plates of foods. These packs were also used when replicators systems went off-line.
Survival rations, such as dried chicken curry. The first Federation colonist-builders on Marona IV were equipped with these until a replicator could be added. 
Ration packs are ideal for zero gravity uses as well. Early space explorers without the benefit of artificial gravity often had to use ration packs. NASA on Earth used these, and surplus units from the various military organizations were sold at PX and surplus stores to civilians. Bajorans also prepared these kinds of meals and used them on their light ships. Captain Benjamin Sisko packed some for he and Jake Sisko to keep his solar sailer trip authentic.
Befitting his meat-and-potatoes food tastes, Chief Miles O'Brien loved them. Ration packs include a very large variety of different menu combinations. Individual stores may be limited based on the convenience of the person distributing the packages however.
