FOOD: Breshtanti ale

An otherwise unidentified alcohol (pronounced "bresh-TAWN-tee") that Koloth either guessed or knew to have been the instrument of Kor's initial hangover while planning their blood oath quest. 

Reference: Blood Oath
This rich brown color should remind you of Watney's or any one of the British or Irish ales you can find in a package store. You can get this color by mixing All Sport Cherry Slam drink with Knudsen natural cranberry juice for a dark almost brownish color; add just a hint of club soda or seltzer or sparkling water for carbonation.
