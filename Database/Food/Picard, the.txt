FOOD: The Picard Cocktail

I don't know whether you'll find this cocktail at Quark's or even whether Guinan served it up in Ten-Forward, but ti'' something you can make at home for the adults. This is a tea drink with a liquor base that you can serve as a cocktail or an after-dinner drink.

8 ounces spring water
1 ounce of Grand Marnier liqueur
1 teaspoon Earl Grey tea leaves

Heat the water to nearly boiling, and pour over the tea, steeping for about 3 minutes. Pour into a cup, straining out the leaves. Slowly pour in the Grand Marnier. Place on a sterling silver platter and serve at once. If your guests should prefer Cointreau, that too, would be acceptable. But what if you want to serve a non-alcoholic version of this?

1/2 cup orange juice
8 ounces spring water
1 teaspoon Earl Grey tea leaves
ice cubes
mint or orange slices

Heat the water to nearly boiling and pour over the tea, steeping for about 3 minutes. Strain off the leaves. Cool the tea in the refrigerator for about 20 minutes. To serve, pour the tea into a tall tumbler, add the orange juice and a few ice cubes. Stir and serve immediately with mint or orange slices.
