FOOD: Tzartak aperitif

A complex, yellow-colored drink mixed by Guinan aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise-D's Ten-Forward lounge. Its flavor is carried entirely by the vapor created when the liquid, cooled to only a half-degree less than the drinker's body temperature, warms to its evaporation point upon contact with the drinker's tongue.
