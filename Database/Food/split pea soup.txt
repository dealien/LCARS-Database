FOOD: split pea soup

An old-Earth recipe that features mushy peas and either a bacon or vegetable stock. 
Based on his father's old recipe, Riker programmed split pea soup into the Enterprise replicator and served a bowl to the visiting J'naii pilot Soren. In his youth it had often "kept him warm on a cold Alaskan night."
