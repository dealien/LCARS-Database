FOOD: Trixian bubble juice

A pink drink served in a tall glass -- when it's not being thrown in your face, as Quark found after he insulted Tetrarch Varis of Bajor's Paqu faction. The sweet pink beverage is also Nog's favorite; Quark once accused Rom of taking a case from his storeroom.

Here's a pink, highly carbonated drink that you can make with pink lemonade mixed with Martinelli's or sparkling water. You can also use pin grapefruit juice concentrate instead of pink lemonade and mix with sparkling water with a spritz of milk. This makes a white frosty drink with a thick head.
