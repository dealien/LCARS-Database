FOOD: spinach

Spinach is an annual plant native to Earth, long cultivated for the sake of its succulent leaves. It is more nourishing than many other green vegetables and a valuable part of the diet. 
Captain Benjamin Sisko's Creole banquet for the senior staff included a dish of creamed spinach. Aboard the U.S.S. Voyager, it was included on Lieutenant Tom Paris' lavish lunch menu bought with two replicator rations he collected as his handling fee in the "Paris radiogenic sweepstakes."
