FOOD: bread pudding souffle

Terran dessert served on the menu at Sisko's in New Orleans. 
Neelix- "This specialty of Sisko's is made with three-day-old or stale bread. It works especially well with greenbread made with infused green tea leaves- no pesto or seaweed here, please. Greenbread from green tea is pungent and is nicely enhanced by the judicious use of brown sugar or honey, cinnamon, vanilla, and cream in this recipe. When chilled, it tastes surprisingly like the green-tea ice cream you can find in Asian markets. Hot, it tastes more like the pudding it's supposed to be.

4 cups or more three-day-old stale bread, chopped into coarse cubes
2 cups raisins, dates, or figs, chopped
4 cups whole milk or 3 cups milk and 1 cup light cream
3 eggs
1/4 cup light brown sugar or honey
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Preheat your oven to 325 degrees. Blend the milk, eggs, brown sugar or honey, and vanilla together with a hand mixer or a blender on low until nice and creamy. Add mixture to the bread cubes and fruit, and either stir through or use your hand mixer on low to combine the ingredients until soggy. Grease a 9-inch baking pan and pour in the mixture, stirring through once or twice to make sure it's thoroughly blended and uniform. Bake for 30 minutes. The top should just turn brown, but don't let it burn.
You can serve this piping hot with ice cream or a fruit topping, or you can serve it cold. If you serve it at room temperature, you should heat some heavy cream with a splash of honey to use as a topping. Serves four.
