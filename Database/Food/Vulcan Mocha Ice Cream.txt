FOOD: Vulcan Mocha Ice Cream

Ensign Kim likes his sweets, sometimes even more than he professes to like Seven of Nine. When she refuses to be assimilated, Harry usually finds his way to the galley to immerse himself in a plate of my homemade Vulcan mocha ice cream. Harry loves Vulcan mocha; he loves ice cream, so I invented this dessert.
The easiest way to prepare this is to buy some chocolate ice cream from the store, stir in a finely ground, dark espresso or Kenya AAA coffee, (1/4 cup coffee to 1 cup ice cream) and refreeze the mixture or simply whip it into an iced drink.
Or you can go completely wild and make the whole thing from scratch.

1/3 cup high-quality unsweetened cocoa powder
1/3 cup sugar
1/2 cup sweetened condensed milk
1 1/2 cups milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract (use mocha syrup if you can find it)
1 cup whipping cream, chilled
1/8 teaspoon finely ground mocha coffee, for garnish

In the top half of a double boiler, combine cocoa, sugar, and condensed and regular milk; bring the mixture to a boil over direct heat, stirring constantly; then put the pan over water simmering in the bottom of the double boiler. Let the mixture cook for about 30 minutes, stirring once or twice. When the cocoa has cooked thoroughly (with no powdery residue), dip the pan into a pan of cold water to cool it down qiickly. Strain the mixture and pour into an ice cream machine; add the vanilla extract (or mocha) and stir in the chilled cream. Follow your machine's directions. Allow it rest in the refrigerator for about 20 minutes to soften before serving. Sprinkle a pinch of mocha coffee, ground to the consistency of turkish coffee, on top to make a decorative pattern.
