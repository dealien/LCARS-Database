FOOD: pepper

Black pepper is a ground seed. Some dispensers serve an already ground variety while a peppermill grinds the peppercorns fresh and on the spot. Finer Terran restaurants would require the server to bring a peppermill to freshly grind the seasoning.
It was used in the broth of a complex dish developed by Dr. Seyetik over several years - added to taste after the broth is reduced in the broiler.
