PERSONNEL: Deela
Queen, planetary leader, Scalos

She was the Queen of the Scalosian civilization who commandeered the U.S.S. Enterprise in 2268, intending to procure a supply of fertile males for the perpetuation of her people. Like all Scalosians, Deela's biochemistry had undergone hyperacceleration, so one hour for her was like one of our seconds. Deela was attracted to James Kirk, and accelerated him to her level. Kirk thwarted her plans, and Deela subsequently returned to Scalos with her people.
