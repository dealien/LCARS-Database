Genetically enhanced human, under the care of Dr Karen Loews. Docile and sensitive, he was sent to Deep Space Nine to allow Dr. Julian Bashir an opportunity to work with him and his group; consisting of Jack, Lauren, and Sabrina. The following year they escaped to DS9 to get help from fellow mutant Bashir for Sabrina. Patrick impersonated a Starfleet Admiral and easily intimidated all others into carrying out his wishes.
