PERSONNEL: Marta Batanides

A female friend of Jean-Luc Picard from his Starfleet Academy class. Batanides and Picard graduated together in 2327, after which the two young ensigns were transferred to Starbase Earhart to await their first deep-space assignments. When Q allowed Picard to relive this portion of his life many years later, Picard acted on a long-held desire to be more than friends with "Marty." Unfortunately, their liaison strained their friendship.
