PERSONNEL: Serova
PhD, warp field specialist, Hekara II

Female Hekaran scientist who discovered that warp-drive ships were slowly destroying the fabric of space in the Hekaras Corridor. She presented her claims to the Federation Science Council which initially found insufficient evidence to back up her theories and declied to act on her recommendation to limit the use of warp drive. 
She continued to work on her theory and enlisted the assistance of her brother Rabal. She was unwilling to wait the year that it would take for Council to complete a review of her claims and chose to booby trap the Hekaras Corridor with verteron mines, theorizing that if the mines disabled enough ships, Starfleet would send a vessel to investigate. The Enterprise-D was dispatched, and it too, became disabled. Captain Jean-Luc Picard reviewed her research and agreed to recommend Serova's work to the Science Council. Serova was still impatient and was killed while proving her theory by triggering a warp core breach in her ship, causing a subspace rupture.
The Federation Science Council subsequently imposed Federation-wide limits on the use of warp drive to avoid furhter damage to the continuum. The restrictions remained in place until advances in warp drive technology made it possible to avoid such damage.
