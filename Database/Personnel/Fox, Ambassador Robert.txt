PERSONNEL: Robert Fox
Ambassador, Federation representative, Eminiar VII

Federation ambassador sent aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise on a diplomatic mission to establish contact with planet Eminiar VII in 2267. Fox disregarded a signal from the planet warning the Enterprise to stay away. When it was learned that Eminiar had been embroiled in a bitter war with neighboring planet Vendikar that had lasted for five centuries, Fox offered his services as mediator. 
This man was later honored when a passenger transport was named after him.
