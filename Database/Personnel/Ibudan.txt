PERSONNEL: Ibudan
Humanoid racketeer in medical supplies, and murderer, who arrived at Deep Space 9 in 2369, seeking vengeance against Odo for having sent him to jail years earlier. The Bajoran provision government released him from his sentence after assuming power; apparently since the new government didn't see murder of Cardassians as a serious crime.
Ibudan planned an elaborate scheme to frame Odo for his murder. He created a clone of himself, then killed it while it engaged in a massage parlor holoprogram. The holosuite's security program only registered one life-form signature, that of Ibudan's. For lack of better suspects a collection of merchants and station guests were convinced that Odo, having the ability to enter the suite undetected, must have been the murderer.
After an exhaustive investigation by Dr. Julian Bashir, who uncovered DNA strands from Ibudan's quarters aboard his transport to DS9, he was able to recognize the cloning work. Odo was then able to link Lamonay S. as an alias being used by the original Ibudan and arrested the man again for murder, since murder of a clone is still considered murder.
