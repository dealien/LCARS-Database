PERSONNEL: K`Temang
Starship commander, I.K.S.

Klingon commander who was slaughtered along with his crew by Gul Dukat in 2372. K'Temang had previously decimated a Cardassian settlement on Korma, and was attempting to confiscate Dukat's freighter Groumal when Kira Nerys transported all 36 Klingons off their bird-of-prey. Dukat then placed K'Temang and his crew aboard the Groumal and destroyed the freighter, seizing K'Temang's ship for himself.
