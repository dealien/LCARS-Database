PERSONNEL: Dereth

Native of the Vidiian Sodality. Dereth was the "honatta" for a fellow Vidiian named Motura, which meant that he was responsible for finding replacement organs for Motura as his organs failed due to the Phage. In 2371, Dereth abducted Neelix from the U.S.S. Voyager, and removed the Talaxian's lungs to be implanted into Motura's body.
