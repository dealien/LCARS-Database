PERSONNEL: James Styles
Captain, starship commadner, U.S.S. Excelsior

Starfleet officer who, in 2285, commanded the U.S.S. Excelsior NX-2000. The Excelsior was the first Federation starship fitted with a transwarp drive. The experiment, however, was unsuccessful. Styles tried in vain to prevent Kirk from going to the Genesis Planet.
