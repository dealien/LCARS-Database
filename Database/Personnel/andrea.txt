PERSONNEL: Andrea
assistant archaeologist, Exo III

Beautiful female android built by archaeologist Roger Korby, using technology left behind on Exo III by an ancient civilization called "the Old Ones" who were destroyed by their own android creations. Andrea was used as an example of the capabilities of the androids in a presentation to Captain James Kirk. During the presentation she was told to kiss Kirk, then to slap him. Both acts appeared to have the same lack of emotion, but the contradiction confused Andrea. When Korby, who had himself assumed an android body, realized he had become more machine than man, he embraced Andrea and fired a phaser blast, killing them both.
