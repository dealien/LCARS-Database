PERSONNEL: Elias Giger
PhD, scientific inventor

Human inventor, possibly demented. Giger was a student of Dr. Bathkin's controversial theories that immortality for humanoids might be achieved by keeping all the cells in the body "entertained." To demonstrate those concepts, Giger constructed a Cellular Regeneration and Entertainment Chamber while visiting Deep Space 9 in 2373. Giger outbid Jake and Nog for a 1951 baseball card of Willie Mays, then offered to trade it for supplies needed for his invention. He was befriended by the Vorta Weyoun, who shared an interest in immortality theories.
