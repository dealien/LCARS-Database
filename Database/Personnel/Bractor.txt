PERSONNEL: Bractor
Starship commander, Kreechta

Bractor stumbled into the middle of a Starfleet war game between the U.S.S. Hathaway and the Enterprise-D in 2365. When Bractor thought the Enterprise was attacking the lesser matched starship he intervened suspecting that the derelict contained valuable Starfleet secrets that he would be able to profit from. He and his ship fell victim to the "Picard maneuver" executed by Commander Riker and his team temporarily stationed aboard the Hathaway.
