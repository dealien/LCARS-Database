PERSONNEL: Gem
test subject, Minara

Empath from a planet in the Minaran star system. Gem was tested by the Vians to determine if her people would be spared the destruction of an impending nova in 2268. Kirk, Spock and McCoy of the Starship Enterprise were captured and subjected to various forms of torture while Gem watched, observing their compassion and willingness to sacrifice their lives for one another. The Vians then observed Gem's reaction, judging whether Gem learned a sense of compassion and sacrifice. Since Gem was willing to give her life to save Dr. McCoy, the Vians became convinced that her civilization was the one to be saved from extinction.
