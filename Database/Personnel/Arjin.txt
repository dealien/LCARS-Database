PERSONNEL: Arjin

Arjin was a prospective Trill host, an initiate in training, who had Jadzia Dax as his field docent. He entered into the training in an attempt to fulfill his father's wishes. He worked hard to attain the goal of joining, winning honors in astrophysics and even becoming a fifth-level pilot. Arjin did not, however, have a clear idea of what he would do with his life, if and when he were joined. Dax pointed this out to him in 2370. It was a difficult realization for Arjin, but it helped him to find a greater sense of purpose.
