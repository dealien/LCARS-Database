PERSONNEL: Woman

A member of Riva's interpretive Chorus (along with Scholar/Artist and Warrior/Adonis), Woman helped keep Riva's other personality archetypes in balance by bringing peace and expressing nurturing. She also represented harmony, wisdom, and the balance that bound together passion and intellect. Woman, and the rest of the Chorus, were killed on Solais V during a failed diplomacy meeting.
