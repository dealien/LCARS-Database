PERSONNEL: Alexander

Platonian citizen who was forced to play the role of jester for the amusement of his people because he was the only one who lacked the telekinetic abilities of the others. This was because Alexander had a hormone deficiency that not only caused his short stature, but prevented him from absorbing the chemical kironide in the food on planet Platonius, which was the source of "the power." When the cause of his lack of power was discovered a cure was offered to him but he denied the treatment as it would make him just like them. Unhappy with his role in society, Alexander befriended the U.S.S. Enterprise landing party in 2268 and eventually left with them.
