Elder brother to Captain Jean-Luc Picard. An old-fashioned man, Robert chose to remain on the family vineyard in Labarre, France. Robert was married to Marie and together they had one son, René. The two Picard brothers clashed with their different lifestyles, but they were reconciled in 2367 when Jean-Luc returned to Labarre to recuperate shortly after his temporary assimilation by the Borg . Robert was killed in a devastating fire in 2371, along with his son.
