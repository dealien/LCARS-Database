PERSONNEL: Stuart Reed

Father of Malcolm Reed. Stuart and Malcolm's mother, Mary, spoke with Captain Archer in 2151. Archer was surprised to learn that Reed has not contacted his parents since he was first assigned to Enterprise. Stuart was irritated that Malcolm chose space exploration over seafaring, as the Reeds have been Navy men for generations.
