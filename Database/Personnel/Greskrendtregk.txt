PERSONNEL: Greskrendtregk

Ktarian man, husband of Starfleet officer Samantha Wildman. He and Ensign Wildman conceived a child in 2371 just prior to her ill-fated stint aboard the U.S.S. Voyager, and their daughter, Naomi Wildman, was born in the Delta Quadrant. Greskrendtregk, therefore, has not met his daughter yet. 
Captain Janeway met Greskrendtregk on Deep Space 9 before Voyager departed for the Badlands and got thrust into the Delta Quadrant.
