PERSONNEL: Enina Tandro

Wife of Klaestron IV's legendary General Ardelon Tandro. The General was believed killed during their 2339 civil war and Enina thereafter fulfilled her role as widow of a great man. Enina and Ardelon had one child, a son, named Ilon who became a diplomat. In 2369 Ilon accused Jadzia Dax of killing Ardelon, based on new evidence showing that Curzon killed Ardelon. During Jadzia's extradition trial, Enina revealed the General's feet of clay and her own involvement with Curzon. Jadzia was then absolved of Ardelon's death.
