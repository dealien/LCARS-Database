PERSONNEL: Moby Dick

Legendary white whale pursued by Captain Ahab in a 19th-century Earth novel of the same name. Written by Herman Melville and first published in 1851. The basis of the story featured the Captain who spent years hunting the whale that had crippled him earlier so that he could exact revenge against it. Apparently well-read throughout the galaxy, officers as diverse as James T. Kirk, Jean-Luc Picard, Tom Paris and Khan Noonien Singh have revealed their affinity for Ahab's crusade. Lily Sloan compared Picard to Ahab because the captain seemed to want revenge on the Borg at any cost.
