PERSONNEL: Hagon
Planetary Leader, Ligon II

Ligonian native. Hagon was the Secondary to the leader Lutan. Unaccustomed to females in positions of authority, Hagon was physically bested by U.S.S. Enterprise-D security chief Tasha Yar. Hagon cheered for Yareena when she challenged Yar to a deadly duel which engraciated him into her heart. After Luton was disgraced his mate Yareena chose to make Hagon her First husband and made Lutan her second. In Ligonian culture the women own the lands and power and give it to their husbands, so this maneuver made Hagon the new planetary leader.
