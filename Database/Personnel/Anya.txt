PERSONNEL: Anya

Guardian of Salia of planet Daled IV. A shape-shifting allasomorph, Anya appeared to the crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise-D as an older human female, although her natural appearance was not known. Originally from the third moon of Daled IV, Anya was protective of Salia in the extreme, and was reluctant to allow Salia to mingle with the Enterprise crew.
