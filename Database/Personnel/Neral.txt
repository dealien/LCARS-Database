PERSONNEL: Neral
Praetor, government leader, Romulus

Former Proconsul of the Romulan Star Empire, he became Praetor in 2374. Neral lost his family in a Klingon raid around 2350, and was hostile to the Vulcan people. He likes archeology, Delvan pudding, and Pensho, his pet set'leth. 

Reference: Unification
Portrayed by Norman Large. The Continuum also says this character was portrayed by Hal Landon, but I assume that was a mistake. The website also displays an image of Romulan Generals from "Star Trek: Nemesis" with this entry, also by mistake.
