PERSONNEL: Krell

A Klingon agent sent to Tyree's planet in an effort to overthrow the Federation-supporting tribes and install a Klingon loyal population from which to expand their Empire. Krell befriended Apella, leader of the Villagers who opposed the Hill People led by Tyree. Krell furnished them with flintlocks, a weapon more powerful than anything on the planet at the time, giving them a decided advantage over their adversaries. Krell promised to make Apella a Governor of the planet under Klingon rule which would also bring riches and power.
Captain James T Kirk discovered the meddling and decided that he too had to equip the planet with flintlocks to maintain the balance of power between the two peoples.
