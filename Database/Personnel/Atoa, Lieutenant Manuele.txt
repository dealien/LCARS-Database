PERSONNEL: Manuele Atoa
Lieutenant, U.S.S. Sutherland

Atoa was good friends with Jadzia Dax and participated in the pre-nuptial ceremonies of Dax and Worf at Deep Space 9. Atoa, a Samoan, performed a ritual fire knife dance. 

Reference: You Are Cordially Invited... 
An actor for this part was originally thought to be hard to cast. Since Paramount strictly follows policy to hire only unionized actors, they were pessimistic about how many Pacific looking- flame playing acctors there were in the Guild. There were more applicants for the part than they ever expected in their wildest dreams.
