PERSONNEL: Russol
Gul

Cardassian informer, one of Security Chief Odo's most reliable sources. Russol was later executed when Cardassia joined the Dominion. Odo performed a favor that indebted this Central Command officer to the shapeshifter. The two have switched information ever since. After Garak's tailor shop was bombed he traveled to secretly meet with his informant who refused to be seen after having altered his appearance since their last meeting.
