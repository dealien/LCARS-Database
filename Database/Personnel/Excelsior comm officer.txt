Communications officer, U.S.S. Excelsior

A relief officer working the late shift on the bridge under the command of Captain Hikaru Sulu. When the U.S.S. Enterprise-A failed to respond to hails by Starfleet Command all starships were ordered to report on the whereabouts of the ship now missing in action. The Excelsior had been in communication with it previously and the captain would have some information helpful to Command. The eager officer woke Captain Sulu to report the situation and to ask the Captain for a reply for Command. Sulu declined, saying he did not know the location of the quiet ship. Knowing that the captain was mistaken, the communications officer attempted to press the issue again and was shot down.
