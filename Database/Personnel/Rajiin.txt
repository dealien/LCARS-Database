PERSONNEL: Rajiin

Beautiful alien slave woman from the planet Oran'taku. Captain Archer rescued her from an alien bazaar, but soon found that Rajiin was sent by the Xindi-Reptilians to gather information about humans using her special skills — she is able to "scan" humanoid physiology and anatomy. This information would help the Xindi in their quest to build a bio-weapon.
