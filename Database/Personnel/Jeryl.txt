PERSONNEL: Jeryl
Captain, starship commander, Lysian vessel

This Lysian captain made was encountered by the original U.S.S. Enterprise when it made attempts to attack and capture a damaged Satarran transport that was under negotiations and protection of the Federation starship. Jeryl ordered his ship to attack the Enterprise too, but those attempts were completely useless against the basic shields of the more powerful vessel. He then agreed to meetings and to escort the larger spaceship to the Lysian homeworld to explain the Lysian position and to justify the legal claims that the Lysian government holds against the Satarran people.
