Mathematician, Earth

He had been working on many math problems during his lifetime. Upon his death observers found the problem he had last been working on and found notes stating that he had solved the puzzle, but didn't find the answer itself. The solution wasn't developed until a time over 300 years later, and was not widely published even into the 24th century where people like Captain Jean-Luc Picard still worked to solve the puzzle.

The theorem was solved after the episode had aired in 1989 by an Italian-American professor at Princeton University, thereby making the solution not well known in the future.
