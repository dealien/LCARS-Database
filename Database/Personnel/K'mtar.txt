PERSONNEL: K'mtar

Alias used by Alexander Rozhenko when he traveled back in time from 2410 to 2370. K'mtar posed as the gin'tak to the House of Mogh and claimed he was sent to protect against an attack on the family. In reality he was there to train his younger self to be a warrior.
In this Alexander's future, Alexander had grown up to become a diplomat and peacemaker. This Alexander tried to stop feuding between the great houses by publicly announcing that the House of Mogh would no longer seek retribution. The future Worf had warned Alexander not to show such weakness, but Alexander called him a "relic from an earlier time" and said that a new era of peace was at hand. His enemies moved against him, killing Worf on the floor of the High Council chamber. Filled with remorse, this Alexander journeyed back in time, calling himself K'mtar, to try to cause his younger self to become a Klingon warrior.

Reference: Firstborn
Played by James Sloyan, who also played Admiral Alidar Jarok in "The Defector," Dr. Mora Pol in "The Alternate" and "The Begotten," and Dr. Ma'Bor Jetrel in "Jetrel." It is not known what influence the future Alexander had on his younger self, and therefore it is not known if Worf will be killed on the floor of the High Council. Alexander did become a warrior, but not a very successful one. He served aboard the same starship as his father during a part of the Dominion War and was transferred to a different post after that.
