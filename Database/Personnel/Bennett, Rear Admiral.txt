PERSONNEL: J. Patrick Bennett
Rear Admiral, judge advocate general, Starfleet Headquarters

Starfleet's Judge Advocate General in 2373, stationed at Starfleet Headquarters on Earth. Captain Sisko contacted Admiral Bennett on behalf of Richard Bashir, who wished to turn himself in for the illegal genetic manipulation of his son, Dr. Julian Bashir, 25 years earlier. In return for the guilty plea, Bennett sentenced the father to two years in a minimum-security penal colony in New Zealand, but allowed the son to retain his Starfleet commission and medical practice. When Julian objected, Bennett denied that the sentence was too harsh - the law against genetic engineering provided a "firewall" against men such as Khan Singh, and it was his job to keep that firewall intact.
