PERSONNEL: Aaron Conor
planetary leader, Moab IV

Leader of the Genome Colony on Moab IV where every resident was genetically engineered and trained for specific roles. Conor was responsible for keeping the 200-year-old colony isolated from outside influences in order to keep their society pure. But an approaching stellar core fragment threatened to destroy the colony, and Conor was faced with a dilemma: If he accepted help from engineers aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise-D, he risked serious cultural contamination, but turning down that help would surely lead to destruction. Ultimately Conor chose to accept the assistance, knowing he would have to deal with the social consequences of exposing his people to outsiders.
