PERSONNEL: Amsha Bashir

Native of Earth, wife of Richard Bashir and mother of Julian Bashir, and often the mediator of tensions between those two. In 2348, concerned about apparent learning disabilities in their son, Amsha conspired with her husband to have illegal genetic enhancement done on Julian just prior to his seventh birthday. She and Richard managed to keep "the family secret" from getting out for 25 years, until they accidentally revealed it before Dr. Lewis Zimmerman during a trip to station Deep Space 9 in 2373. Richard subsequently accepted a two-year prison sentence in return for Julian being allowed to keep his Starfleet commission, an action which Amsha supported.
