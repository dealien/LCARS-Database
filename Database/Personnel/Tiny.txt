PERSONNEL: Douglas Alan Shanklin
Security officer, Federation correctional holding facility

This officer was assigned to guard Dr. Leonard McCoy after he became confused as a result of the melding with Spock's katra. While his partner attempted to allow Admiral Kirk some time to visit with the prisoner, this guard remained at his desk. Commander Sulu tried small talk with the man, but instead he insulted the Starfleet officer by calling him "Tiny." Kirk and Sulu's visit was a jailbreak, so Sulu dispatched the larger man while Kirk handled the other.
