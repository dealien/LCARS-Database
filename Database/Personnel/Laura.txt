PERSONNEL: Laura

Human who was assimilated by the Borg during the devastating battle at Wolf 359 in 2367. Laura had a recessive gene mutation that allowed her to experience Unimatrix Zero while regenerating. But in 2377 she participated in a plan to destroy the dreamstate realm, although not until the crew of the U.S.S. Voyager ensured that all its occupants would retain their memories and individuality while awake as drones. Presumably Laura, in the physical world, was to help form a resistance movement to undermine the Collective from within.
