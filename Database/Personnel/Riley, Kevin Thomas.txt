PERSONNEL: Kevin Thomas Riley
Navigator, U.S.S. Enterprise

Early in his life, Riley witnessed the massacre of his parents and 4,000 others on Tarsus IV by Kodos the Executioner. While serving aboard the Enterprise in 2266, Riley witnessed the death of Kodos, going by the alias Anton Karidian, during a performance of "Hamlet." 
He fancied himself to be descended from Irish Kings, and this trait surfaced while he was under the intoxicating efects of the Psi 2000 virus, during which Riley nearly caused the destruction of the Enterprise when he shut down the ship's main engines.
