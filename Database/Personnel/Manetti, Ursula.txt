PERSONNEL: Ursula Manetti
Ambassador, liaison to Klingon Embassy, Earth

This diplomatic person was the last Earth based liaison to the Klingon office in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, Earth. Better relations between the two government led to better understanding of the two different cultures and the need for an additional liaison officer was no longer necessary at the Ambassadorial level. Upon leaving her post she made a recommendation that an diplomatic attache be left at the post to assist the embassy with any further needs it may have; and Kassa Kurati was appointed to that job.
This influencial Terran woman was a large influence on the lives of her staff and alien contacts. Her chief aide, Kassa Kurati, and her became close friends over the year to the point that the gentleman felt it justified to name his daughter after the woman. She continued to be a large part of the life of that family even after she retired her post.
