Legendary Vulcan ambassador and an idol of T'Pol's, V'Lar's 94-year career included negotiating the first territorial accords between Vulcan and Andoria. She also met a young T'Pol at the Ka'Tann conference, and was impressed with the young Vulcan. In 2152, V'Lar infiltrated the Mazarite government to gather evidence against corrupt officials. As part of the plan, she was accused of misconduct, and extracted by Enterprise NX-01.
