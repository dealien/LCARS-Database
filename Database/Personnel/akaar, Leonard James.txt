PERSONNEL: Leonard James Akaar
Planetary leader, Capella IV

Son of the late Teer Akaar and his widow, Eleen, on planet Capella IV. Born 2267 shortly after his father was killed in a Klingon-induced power struggle. Leonard James Akaar inherited the title of "teer," or chief, of the Ten Tribes. His mother served as regent until the boy came of age to rule. 
The name Leonard James was given in honor of Doctor Leonard McCoy and Captain James Kirk who helped to protect her and her unborn child from civil unrest between the leaders of the Ten Tribes. The granting of the name was expected to make the two insufferably proud of themselves for at least a month according to Commander Spock's assessment.
