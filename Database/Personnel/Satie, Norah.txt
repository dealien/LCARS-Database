PERSONNEL: Norah Satie
Admiral, judge advocate general, Starfleet Command

Daughter of noted judge Aaron Satie, Norah achieved renown as a stringent investigator. Norah was one of the investigators that exposed the alien conspiracy against Starfleet in 2364, after which she retired with distinction. She was called back into active duty for an investigation aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise-D in 2367. Romulan espionage was suspected before an explosion turned out to be an accident from faulty parts installation. She improperly continued her hearch for conspirators and got out of hand, turning this into a witch hunt. She even made serious accusations regarding Captain Jean-Luc Picard's loyalty to the Federation. Her investigation did reveal several unassociated truths, that crewman Tasrs was of Romulan descent, not Vulcan. And that J'Dan was, in fact, a Romulan spy.
