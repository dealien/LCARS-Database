PERSONNEL: Elizabeth Cutler
Crewman, exobiologist, Enterprise NX01

An exobiologist serving on the Enterprise NX-01, Cutler has a specialty in entomology. She was part of the away team that was infected with a strange hallucinogen while trapped by a storm on a mysterious Earth-like planet's surface. Later, she was mentored by Dr. Phlox to become a part-time medic, assisting him in his research on the crisis on Valakis and tending to an injured Ensign Mayweather while the doctor was partaking of his annual hibernation. She also developed a romantic attraction to Phlox, and enjoyed taking in the occasional movie with him. Ultimately, however, she told the doctor that she just wanted to be friends. Cutler also tried to befriend the aloof T'Pol, but to no avail.
