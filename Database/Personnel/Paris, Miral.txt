PERSONNEL: Miral Paris

Daughter of Tom Paris and B'Elanna Torres in an alternate future. In this timeline, Voyager eventually returned to Earth, but at great cost to the crew. Admiral Janeway, seeking to rectify her decision that set these events in motion, enlisted the quarter-Klingon Miral, a Starfleet ensign, in a complex plan to obtain a certain device from Klingon High Council member Korath. The young officer's scrappy attitude prompted Janeway to affectionately dub Miral "[her] mother's daughter."
After Admiral Janeway helped alter the timeline, Tom and B'Elanna's daughter was born in sickbay just as Voyager returned from the Delta Quadrant. It was not noted if they decided to name her Miral, as they did in the alternate timeline.
