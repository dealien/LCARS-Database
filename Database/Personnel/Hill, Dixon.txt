PERSONNEL: Dixon Hill
Private Investigator, San Francisco, Earth

Fictional detective from the Dixon Hill series of short stories and novels set in San Francisco, Earth, in the 1930s and '40s. Dixon Hill first appeared in the short story "The Big Goodbye", by Tracy Torme, in pulp magazine Amazing Detective Stories in 1934. Dixon Hill novels have included 'The Long Dark Tunnel' (published 1936) and 'The Parrot's Claw' (published circa 1940). Enterprise-E Captain Jean-Luc Picard was an aficionado of the Dixon Hill stories and enjoyed holodeck simulations based on them. The Dixon Hill holodeck program was sufficiently sophisticated that Picard once instructed the computer to 'improvise' and create the Dixon Hill environment only, without any specific story elements. Picard's attempt to enjoy the resulting scenario was unfortunately ruined when Betazoid ambassador Lwaxana Troi (see file) wandered into the simulation and became attracted to one of the characters, unaware that he was merely a simulation. Picard introduced Guinan (see file) to the Dixon Hill adventures while the Enterprise-D was en route to Evadn IV. In 2372, Captain Jean-Luc Picard ran his Dixon Hill program with the safeties deactivated so that he could use a machine gun to neutralize some Borg drones when they attempted to take over the Enterprise-E.
