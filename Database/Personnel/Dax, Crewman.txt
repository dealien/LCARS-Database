PERSONNEL: Dax
Crewman, U.S.S. Enterprise-A

A young Starfleet officer serving aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise-A in 2293. He was briefly suspected of being one of the "hit men" who assassinated Klingon Chancellor Gorkon, because a pair of magnetic boots - the incriminating evidence being desperately searched for on the ship - was found in his personal locker. But it became quickly evident that Dax's large webbed feet could have never fit into those boots.
