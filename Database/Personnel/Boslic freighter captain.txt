PERSONNEL: Boslic frieghter captain

Beautiful, seductive officer who delivered Li Nala's earring to Quark on Deep Space 9; she had received it from a maintenance worker on Cardassia IV who asked her to take it to Bajor. Later, on Stardate 48214, she salvaged a ship that had crashed in the Gamma Quadrant and sold it to Quark for three bars of latinum. That wreckage had within it a Jem'Hadar infant. In late 2372, Odo suspected her of trafficking in stolen Falangian diamonds.
