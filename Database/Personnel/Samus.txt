PERSONNEL: Samus
Captain, starship commander, Wooden

A Satarran captain that was piloting a damaged, loaded transport trying to escape Lysian Navy patrols. Samus was a regular smuggler of Satarran rebels out of the Lysian occupied areas into Rebel bases. A distress call sent by Captain Samus was received by the original U.S.S. Enterprise which offered aid to the struggling rebels. Samus sought protection from the Federation starship when a Lysian Navy vessel also responded to the distress call and tried to capture the smaller craft. Samus sought mediation from Captain April in the dispute between the Lysian and Satarran sides of their conflict. He agreed to travel to Lysia Cylone, the homeworld, for formal negotiations with Lysian government officials even though he was convinced that the Lysian offering was an attempt to outnumber and overtake the transport and the accompanying starship.
