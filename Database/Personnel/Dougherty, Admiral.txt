PERSONNEL: Anthony Dougherty
Vice Admiral, Ba'ku Project

This man commanded the research teams that were studying the Ba'ku people, and oversaw the delicate holographic reconstruction of their city. He was also responsible for the delicate negotations with the Son'a teams that were partnered on the project. He set up his office on the Son'a flagship and worked clsoely with Adhar Ru'afo. He arranged to acquire a cloacked holoship that he planned to use to secretly move the people off of the planet and on to a new homeworld. He requested the assistance of Lieutenant Commander Data to work on the project but the android suffered damage after a Son'a attack. Dougherty ordered the engineering data on Data so that he could be repaired. Captain Picard took the Enterprise into the Briar Patch, against Dougherty's recommendation, in an attempt to help the android crewman. Picard learned of the subversive actions of the Admiral and defied his order to leave the system. Picard instead stood up to the senior officer to defend the rights of the local inhabitants. Dougherty gave the order to Son'a warships to open fire on the U.S.S. Enterprise-E when that ship attempted to call for help. Son'a leader Ru'afo despised Dougherty's pessimistic assessment of the situation and killed the man when he refused to take additional steps to speed up the resettlement process or to allow use of a deadly radiation experiment.
