PERSONNEL: Darek

Citizen of the time-displaced planet that the U.S.S. Voyager encountered in 2376. Darek owned the building that Voyager's Doctor lived in while he was visiting the surface (where time passed at an accelerated rate), until a war broke out that lasted a few weeks and left the apartment building in ruins. Darek, like most of his people, liked nothing better than to speculate about the "Skyship," which was actually Voyager stuck above their planet. Darek would go on and on, "Skyship this, Skyship that," according to the Doctor.
