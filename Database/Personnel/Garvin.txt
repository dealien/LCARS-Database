PERSONNEL: Garvin

Town magistrate on planet Barkon IV; a widower with a daughter named Gia. Garvin and Gia took Data - whom they named "Jayden" - into their home when the android wandered into their village with amnesia in 2370. Garvin developed radiation poisoning after being exposed to fragments from a Federation deep space probe that Data had unwittingly carried in. He was later cured of the radiation sickness by Data.

Played by Michael Rothhaar. I can't tell if the image posted on the Continuum has Garvin in it or not- the main subjects are clearly not, but Garvin maybe facing away from the camera. Not a good image and most likely posted on the website by mistake.
