PERSONNEL: Jeremiah Rossa
a.k.a. Jono

Young boy whose father, Connor, was a Starfleet officer. Jeremiah was born in 2353 at a Federation colony on Galen IV. He survived the attack by Talarian forces, but lost his parents. He was captured and raised by a Talarian named Endar. While on a training mission aboard a Talarian observation craft the vessel suffered mechanical problems and the U.S.S. Enterprise arrived to assist. They identified the young Terran and contact his surviving family; Admiral Connaught Rossa. His new father Endar arrived to assist the juveniles and demanded that Jono be returned to him. Jono was raised to admire strong masculine figures and bonded with Captain Jean-Luc Picard instead of Wesley Crusher. The two shared quarters for a stint until Picard made the decision to return the young man to his new family. During their time together Picard tried to convince Jono of his Terran heritage and the teen stabbed the senior. He expected harsh punishment for his assault but Picard recognized the confusion and dismissed the event.
