PERSONNEL: T'Para

A character in the Vulcan song "Falor's Journey." T'Para was known as a source of truth whom Falor sought wisdom from, per the following narrative: 
"Falor was a prosperous merchant, who went on a journey
to gain greater awareness.
Through storms he crossed the Voroth Sea
To reach the clouded shores of Raal
Where old T'Para offered truth.
He traveled through the windswept hills
And crossed the barren Fire Plains
To find the silent monks of Kir
Still unfulfilled, he journeyed home
Told stories of the lessons learned
And gained true wisdom by the giving."
