Elderly woman from Enara Prime who was killed aboard U.S.S. Voyager because she told B'Elanna Torres the secret of her government's genocide against a people known as the Regressives decades earlier. 

B'Elanna Torres fully inhabited this identity in a tangible dream world, where she was passionately in love with an Enaran named Dathan. Investigation revealed that Torres was actually the recipient of the real Korenna's memories of genocide committed against Regressives.
