PERSONNEL: Reginald Barclay
Lieutenant, engineering officer, U.S.S. Enterprise-D

Although he may appear to be nervous and lacking in confidence, Reg Barclay is a highly talented Starfleet systems diagnostic engineer. Stationed aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise NCC-1701-D from 2366, Barclay had a tendency to spend more time inside the holodeck than in real social situations. Barclay also suffered from severe transporter phobia in 2369, although he seems to have overcome this psychological barrier.
At one point he was dubbed with the nickname "Broccoli" by acting Ensign Wesley Crusher. The rumor of the name even made it back to the command staff that accidentally used it to address him once.
While stationed aboard the new U.S.S. Enterprise NCC-1701-E in 2373, and through a strange turn of events involving the Borg, Barclay was able to meet one of his idols, Zefram Cochrane. By 2376, Barclay's main focus was developing a means of communicating with the missing U.S.S. Voyager crew still stranded in the Delta Quadrant. In an alterante future, Barclay was adopted by the Voyager crew as an honorary family member and participated in many reunion style events after the return of that starship from the Delta Quadrant. Barclay tried to keep secret a secret plan by Admiral Janeway to travel back in time to bring her crew home earlier than the one timeline had indicated, shortening their trip by 15 years.
