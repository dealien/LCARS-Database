PERSONNEL: Borath

Vorta analyst who conducted an experiment on officers captured from the U.S.S. Defiant in 2371. Borath caused the Starfleet crew to experience an illusory Dominion invasion of the Alpha Quadrant, in a test by the Founders to see how much resistance they might encounter. Borath and the Founders learned that Sisko and his staff were willing to destroy the Bajoran wormhole to keep the Dominion on their side of the galaxy, and would risk their careers and their lives to do so.
