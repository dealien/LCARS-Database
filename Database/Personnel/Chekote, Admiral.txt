PERSONNEL: Chekote
Admiral, sector commander, Starbase 227

Starfleet official stationed at Starbase 227 in 2370. Chekote invoked the Prime Directive in ordering evacuation of Deep Space 9 when a Bajoran extremist faction attempted to seize the station. He did this despite evidence that the Cardassians were backing the activities of this faction, known as The Alliance for Global Unity or "The Circle." 
That same year, Admiral Chekote gave William Riker permission to delay a previously scheduled mission and investigate Captain Picard's apparent death at planet Dessica II, placing the Enterprise-D on detached duty for this investigation.
