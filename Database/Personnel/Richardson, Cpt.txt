PERSONNEL: Richardson
Captain, starship commander

While attending Starfleet Academy, Richardson sought the advice of groundskeeper Boothby. It seems Boothby's advice was heeded by more than one future Starfleet captain as cadet Jean-Luc Picard also consulted the groundskeeper during his cadet days.
