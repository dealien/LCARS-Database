PERSONNEL: Cyrano Jones

A rotund entrepreneur who made a living selling odd merchandise like Spican flame gems and Antarian Glow Water. Tribbles were also a part of his questionable inventory. While aboard the station Deep Space Station K-7 he becmae embroiled in a dispute between Starfleet and Federation personnel when his tribbles multiplied prodigiously. The animals consumed valuable grains that were stored in the stations bins in reserve for use in colonizing the nearby Sherman's Planet. He inadvertently helped uncover a Klingon plot, in 2267, to control Sherman's Planet when the tribbles died as a result of a poison mixed in the grain. The tribbles, which also infested the U.S.S. Enterprise, became very bothersome to Captain James Kirk who considered charging Jones with the crime of transporting harmful items, a penalty of 20 years in jail. Instead he was convinced to assign Jones with the responsibility of collecting every single Tribble from the station, a task that Spock estimated would take 17 years based on his calculation that there were 1,771,561 animals aboard.
One of his attempts to control the population was to acquire a ???? animal from the tribble's homeworld. It was the only known predator of the animals and is capable of consuming several per hour. His plan was not entirely successful when the animals grew too large in size to be able to be eaten by the carnivore.
