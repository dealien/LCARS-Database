PERSONNEL: Freddy Bristow
Ensign, U.S.S. Voyager

Young crewman aboard the U.S.S. Voyager, considered to be tall and good-looking. Tom Paris observed that Ensign Bristow would make any excuse he could to hang around Engineering, apparently to get close to Lt. Torres. Torres acknowledged that Bristow had a crush on her, but she considered him a "child" and denied ever having any interest in him. Although Bristow was known to play a mean set of Parrises Squares, Torres took him on in one game and whipped him (or so she claimed).
