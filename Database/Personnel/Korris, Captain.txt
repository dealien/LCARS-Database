Klingon dissident and criminal. Korris and comrades, Lieutenant Konmel and Kunivas, wrecked two ships escaping Klingon confinement, the Batris and the T'Acog. They were captured by the U.S.S. Enterprise NCC-1701-D. Kunivas died before Klingon authorities could retrieve him.

Played by Vaughn Armstrong, who also played Gul Danar in "Past Prologue," Telek R'Mor in "Eye of the Needle," another Klingon captain in "Sleeping Dogs," and Admiral Forrest throughout ENT. The Continuum states that he died, when it was really his friend- and the website made the same mistake regarding the third in their party, Konmel. His posting to theT'Acog is conjectural but it has been speculated that the trio were assigned officers that attempted to use the starship for their purposes until the rest of the crew committed mutiny and captured them to turn over to the High Council or other authority.
