PERSONNEL: Ben Beatty

A civilian aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise-D who worked as a waiter in Ten-Forward. Ben was poker buddies with several junior officers, but also occasionally played with senior officers, and was even on a first-name basis with Commander Riker. He always tried to stay in the loop on ship gossip, and often eavesdropped on the conversations of senior officers. He relished being a civilian on a starship and would tease his Starfleet friends for taking their careers so seriously.
