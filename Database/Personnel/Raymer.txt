PERSONNEL: Raymer
Captain, starship commander, U.S.S. Destiny

Commanding officer of the U.S.S. Destiny, the ship that was assigned to transport the Dax symbiont back to the Trill homeworld after the death of Jadzia Dax in 2374. When the health of the symbiont began to fail, Captain Raymer had it implanted in the only Trill on board, Ensign Ezri Tigan. Raymer granted her ship's assistant counselor leave from the Destiny while the newly joined Ezri Dax adjusted. Ultimately Ezri opted to remain on Deep Space 9 with a promotion, rather than rejoin Raymer's crew.
