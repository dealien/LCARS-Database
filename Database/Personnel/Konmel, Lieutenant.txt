PERSONNEL: Konmel
Lieutenant, I.K.S. T'Acog

Klingon political fugitive disgusted by the softening Klingon will. Konmel, along with Captain Korris and Kunivas, were wanted by Klingon authorities and being returned to Qo'noS aboard the T'Acog when they escaped, boarded the Batris transport, and used the minimal weapons of the freighter to destroy the starship. They then caused the destruction of the cargo vessel just as they were rescued by the U.S.S. Enterprise-D.

Played by Charles B. Hyman. The Continuum indicated the names of two associates, but listed Konmel as his own partner, then said he died. Kunivas was the 3rd officer and the one who died. His posting to theT'Acog is conjectural but it has been speculated that the trio were assigned officers that attempted to use the starship for their purposes until the rest of the crew committed mutiny and captured them to turn over to the High Council or other authority.
