PERSONNEL: Arriaga
Lieutenant, Deep Space 9

In 2373, under orders from Admiral Leyton, Arriage attached a subspace modulator to the relay satellite on the far side of the Bajoran wormhole to create the appearance that cloacked ships were coming through, feeding Federation fears of an imminent Dominion invasion. When confronted, Arriaga confessed his role in Leyton's conspiracy. Leyton subsequently attempted unsuccessfully to have the U.S.S. Defiant destroyed which transported Arriaga back to Earth to testify to the plot.
