PERSONNEL: Eris

Vorta with telekinetic abilities who encountered Benjamin Sisko on a planet in the Gamma Quadrant in 2370. Eris was a Dominion agent who posed as a fugitive from the Jem'Hadar and was held by a small group of Jem'Hadar soldiers. When Sisko and Quark were also captured, she helped them escape. Upon their return to Deep Space 9, Eris was found to be a spy, but she escaped from the station before she could be questioned further, but not before warning the crew that their brush with the Founders has only just begun.
