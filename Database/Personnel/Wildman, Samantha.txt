Portrayed by Nancy Hower. Wildman got a first name in "Deadlock." "Elogium" co-writer Jimmy Diggs named the character in honor of Samantha Wildman, a very special girl who lived in Florida. When tragedy struck, taking Samantha's life at the age of only seven, her parents donated Samantha's kidneys for transplantation, saving the life of Digg's wife, Linnette. Diggs learned that the real Samantha loved animals, so he made her Voyager namesake the head of the ship's xenobiology department.
