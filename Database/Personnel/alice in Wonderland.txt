PERSONNEL: Alice
Fictional character

Title character of the Earth children's book "Alice in Wonderland," written by 19th-century author Lewis Carroll. A facsimile of Alice appeared on the so-called "amusement park planet" in the Omicron Delta region when it was being visited by the crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise in 2267. Dr. Leonard McCoy mentioned that the world looked like it belonged to the fanciful realm of that book, thus the planet's computer created the characters of Alice and the White Rabbit to interact with the visitors.
