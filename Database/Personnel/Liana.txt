PERSONNEL: Liana

Kantare daughter of Ezral. Ezral and Liana were the only survivors of a crash-landing after an ion storm disabled their ship. Liana was a child at the time of the crash, and her father left his post to save her. Feeling guilty, he would go on to create holograms of the dead crew to keep Liana company as she grew up. Liana revealed her father's scheme to the crew of the Enterprise NX-01 when they discovered the shipwreck and offered assistance. She also formed a somewhat romantic bond with Trip Tucker, who gave her a tour of Enterprise and introduced her to the wonder of ice cream.
