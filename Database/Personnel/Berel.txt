PERSONNEL: Berel
Doctor, facility director, Sikla Medical facility, Malcor III

Physician in charge of the Sikla Medical Facility on Malcor III. In 2367 Berel treated the injured Rivas Jakara and found that he was an alien surgically altered to look Malcorian. This alien was William Riker on a covert surveillance mission on the planet. Berel refused to allow Malcorian security to interrogate Riker, and so he was relieved as head of the Sikla facility.
