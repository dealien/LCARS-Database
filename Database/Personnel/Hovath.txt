PERSONNEL: Hovath
Sirah, Bajor

Inhabitant of a village on Bajor who was apprentice to the Sirah. Hovath studied for nine years to be the next Sirah, learning the secrets of the storyteller. Hovath was nevertheless unready to assume the responsibility when his mentor was ready to die in 2369. The old Sirah took the seemingly irrational step of appointing Miles O'Brien as the new Sirah, thereby motivating Hovath to try much harder.
