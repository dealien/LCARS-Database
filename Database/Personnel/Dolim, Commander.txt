PERSONNEL: Dolim
Commander, Sect Leader, Xindi Reptilian

This ruthless military commander was one of the strongest proponents for the creation and use of the Xindi weapon against Earth. He recognized that the Xindi Council was necessary to maintain the peace between the races, or there would be another loss like that of the Avians. But he also felt that he was capable of taking solitary lead of the combined races- replacing the Council with a single leader. His greed for power caused many problems. He also had private advise sessions from the Sphere Builders- the race manipulating the Xindi into war with Earth. They recognized that he was motivated to continue with war while the rest of the Council wanted other options.
As a Council member his opinion was one of those that voted for the construction and launch of the test weapon, and was in the minority to launch the final weapon on Earth. When his choice was voted down he enlisted the help of the Xindi Insectoid leaders and the two races worked together to steal the weapon from the others and launch it anyway.
Dolim ordered the capture of Ensign Hoshi Sato from the Enterprise NX-01 to use her translation skills to decipher the unknown launch codes so that he could arm and use the weapon. Degra led the forces to recapture the weapon and was assisted by Shran of the Andorian Guard. Dolim's ship was stopped, and the weapon destroyed.
