PERSONNEL: Ari Bem Bem
Commander (honorary), independant observer, Pandroni

A colony being- diplomat sent on a mission to observe the operations of the U.S.S. Enterprise and see how Starfleet operates before his race would decide if they would join the United Federation of Planets or not. The observer had declined to mingle with the crew during many of the missions until they came up on Delta Theta III. On that mission he insisted that he accompany the contact team. He programmed the transporter console to the beam down site and carefully chose the edge of a cliff, so that he and some of the crew would fall into the water. While there he separated his body parts and used the cover of underwater to pick-pocket the landing party and remove their phasers.
Bem allowed himself to be captured by the aboriginees on the planet.
