PERSONNEL: Jenna D`Sora
Lieutenant, security officer, U.S.S. Enterprise-D

Security officer aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise-D. In 2367 Lt. D'Sora broke up with her boyfriend Jeff Arton, and while "on the rebound" began a brief romance with Data. Despite the android's attempts to program himself with the intricacies of love, the relationship was awkward. At one point Jenna told Data that there was something artificial about his behavior, and Data concurred, reminding her that all of his behavior was based on a program and therefore artificial. Before long she broke off the relationship, realizing that her previous boyfriend was unemotional and that her choice of Data, a man completely incapable of emotion, indicated a pattern that she could no longer deny.
