PERSONNEL: Doyle

Human male, Doyle was a former Maquis member who joined the U.S.S. Voyager in 2371. Doyle never quite got over his distrust of Tuvok, who had betrayed Chakotay's Maquis crew. In 2377, Doyle vocalized those sentiments when ex-Maquis crewmembers on Voyager were being mysteriously attacked and Chakotay's former crew had to start taking special precautions.
