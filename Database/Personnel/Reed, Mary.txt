PERSONNEL: Mary Reed

Mother of Malcolm Reed. In 2151, Mary and her husband, Stuart Reed, were contacted by Captain Archer because the captain wanted to know Malcolm's favorite birthday food. Talking to Mary, Archer was surprised to learn that Malcolm had not spoken with his parents since he was first assigned to Enterprise. 
As Malcolm's birthday neared, Archer still wondered what his tactical officer's favorite food was. But Mary reported that her son never made any special requests, food-wise.
