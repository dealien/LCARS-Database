PERSONNEL: Toby Russell, MD
Doctor, medical officer, Adelman Neurological Institute

Distinguished, if at times unethical, doctor who pioneered the genetronic replicator. This device, capable of growing new organs at an accelerated rate, was used successfully by Russell on Worf in 2368 to help repair his shattered spinal column. Her career did accumulate several accusations that she sacrificed a patient's life to acquire the experimental data, but apparently none of the complaints were ever pursued.
