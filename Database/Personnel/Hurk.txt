PERSONNEL: Hurk
Captain, starship commander, U.S.S. Enterprise-F

A Fetlik citizen and Starfleet captain in command of the flagship of the fleet, the U.S.S. Enterprise-F. He was an occasional patron of the "Captain's Table" bar where alien captains from all timelines came together. In one event he entered the bar when Julius Ramsey was recanting the tale of his last mission aboard the U.S.S. Sutherland. Hurk took a seat next to Matt Morden, a fellow Starfleet captain from his own time, to listen to the story of history.
