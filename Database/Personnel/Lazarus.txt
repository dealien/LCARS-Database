PERSONNEL: Lazarus
Science officer

The man who created the so-called door in the universe that granted egress to the antimatter universe. The door released an anti-Lazarus who Lazarus believed was trying to kill him. It turned out that Lazarus was mentally unstable and the anti-Lazarus recognized the catastrophic potential of the interdimentional door so he sacrificed himself in an attempt to kill Lazarus and prevent that man from causing any potential danger.
