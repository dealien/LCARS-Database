engineering officer, Melona IV

Starfleet engineer who was helping to design the expansion of the Federation colony on Melona IV in 2368 when the outpost was destroyed by the Crystalline Entity. Carmen was a friend of William Riker, and they enjoyed having dinner together, especially when it came to her memorable desserts. When the Crystalline Entity attacked, she was killed while trying to help other colonists evacuate. Riker wrote a letter of condolence to Carmen's family when Starfleet notified them of her death and returned her personal effects.
