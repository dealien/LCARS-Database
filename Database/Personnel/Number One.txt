This character was not named in the TV show so parts of the actresses real name were used. This character was played on TV by M. Leigh Hudek, who later changed her name to Majel Barrett Roddenberry. She was originally intended to be a regular on the series, but was dropped based on insistence from the network. Roddenberry, struggled with the choice about dropping the character or fighting to maintain her, but he chose to fight for the continued appearance of Mr. Spock instead, and promoted him to the position of executive officer. The actor also played several other characters including Christine Chapel, Lwaxanna Troi, and did voices for the animated series, various computers, and a host of games.
