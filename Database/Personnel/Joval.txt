PERSONNEL: Joval
Beautiful Risan female who was prepared to offer Picard "jamaharon" (a Risan sexual term) when he inadvertantly displayed a Horga'hn (a Risan statuette that symbolizes sexual desire). Unaware of the cultural implications of the object, Picard had gotten the Horga'hn at Riker's request, and was unaware of Joval's intent. After he was propositioned and she pointed out the statue, Picard realized why Riker had requested the item, to set-up his captain, and he quickly concealed the symbol.
