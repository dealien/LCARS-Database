PERSONNEL: Jeremy Aster

Son of U.S.S. Enterprise-D officer Lieutenant Marla Aster. Jeremy was orphaned when his mother died on an away mission in 2366. His father had died five years earlier of a Rushton infection. After Marla Aster's death, energy-based life-forms known as Koionians expressed regret at their accidental part in the incident and offered to care for Jeremy. Their care would have been delivered by a nearly identical replcia of his late mother, in an environment that closely reproduced his home on Earth. Jeremy eventually found the courage to accept his mother's loss, and became a part of Worf's family through the Klingon R'uustai, or bonding, ceremony. Jeremy later returned to Earth to be raised by his biological aunt and uncle.
