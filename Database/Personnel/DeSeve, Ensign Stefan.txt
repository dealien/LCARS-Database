PERSONNEL: Stefan DeSeve

Former Starfleet ensign who renounced his Federation citizenship and gave his allegiance to the Romulan Empire in 2349. DeSeve found the Romulan system of absolute values and strong sense of purpose to be appealing, but he later came to realize that right and wrong isn't always so black-and-white. After living on Romulus for 20 years, he became disillusioned by Romulan society and their ethics, and surrendered to the Federation in 2369 to aid the defection of Romulan Vice-Proconsul M'ret.
