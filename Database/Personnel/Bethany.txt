PERSONNEL: Bethany

School teacher on the Skagaran planet. Bethany was three-quarters human, one quarter Skagaran. She was also one of the only humans on the planet sympathetic to the Skagarans' plight, going so far as to teach the alien children, even though it was illegal. Bethany was arrested by Deputy Bennings for this offense, but was freed by Captain Archer and wounded during the escape attempt. Archer had no choice but to beam her up for medical treatment. After she was treated, Bethany returned to the newly-enlightened planet, where she was finally able to teach both humans and Skagarans legally.
