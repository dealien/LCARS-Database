PERSONNEL: Bele

Chief officer of the Commission on Political Traitors from the planet Cheron. White on the left side of his body and black on the right, Bele harbored racial bigotry against those of his people whose coloring was the reverse. For 50,000 years he pursued an alleged traitor named Lokai across the galaxy, and caught up with him on the U.S.S. Enterprise in 2268. Bele hijacked the Enterprise to take his prisoner back to Cheron, but when they arrived they discovered a world long since destroyed by racial hatred. Lokai escaped to the surface, and Bele followed to continued his obsessive and meaningless pursuit. The Enterprise left them there to decide their own fates.
