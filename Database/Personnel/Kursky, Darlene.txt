PERSONNEL: Darlene Kursky

Secretary to Douglas Pabst at Incredible Tales magazine (in Ben Sisko's subconscious vision of ancient New York). Darlene thought Benny Russell's science-fiction story "Deep Space Nine" was the best thing she'd read since "The Puppet Masters."  She loved the creative stroke to put a worm into the one character's tummy.

Reference: Far Beyond the Stars 
Played by Terry Farrell/ Jadzia Dax. The tummy joke was directly related to the fact that she portrays that character too.
