MEDICAL: Enantiodromia

A mental dysfunction literally meaning "conversion into the opposite." In 2368 aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise, the newly orphaned Timothy adopted the unemotional, seemingly perfect android guise of Data due to the trauma of the loss of his parents and the misplaced guilt that he caused their deaths.
