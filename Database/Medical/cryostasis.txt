MEDICAL: cryostasis

A Federation medical procedure commonly used to slow down a critically injured patient's biological functions, thereby allowing more time to diagnose and repair the problem. On stardate 46922 Dr. Julian Bashir wanted to put a critically injured Klingon first officer into cryostasis, but the patient died before reaching space station Deep Space Nine. 
Cryostasis was previously used by earlier scientists for persons that had deceased hoping that future science would find cures to the illnesses and revive the "frozen" patients. The persons were often stored in cryosatellites and sent into space instead of being stored on the planet. The U.S.S. Enterprise-D encountered the S.S. Birdseye with three such patients which they were able to resurrect and cure.
Cryonics was also used in early long distance space exploration to put the passengers to sleep so that they could endure the long travel times. The sleeping saved on life support services like food/water, oxygen, heat, etc. The S.S. Botany Bay was a sleeper ship encountered by the U.S.S. Enterprise with a crew in hibernation.
