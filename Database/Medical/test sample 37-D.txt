MEDICAL: test sample 37-D (delta)

One of the many ineffective samples run while a fatigued Doctor Bashir races to find an antidote to the aphasia-like virus and analyzed just as he realizes he has the disease. The computer's summary of the test was: "Sample 37-Delta ineffective. Viral protein sheath unaffected. Nucleotide sequence remains intact."
