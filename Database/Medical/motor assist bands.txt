MEDICAL: motor assist bands

Several small, electronically sensitive strap-like devices used with neurologically damaged patients in assisting motor recovery. By providing electrical stimulation to the patient's limbs, injured or damaged muscles can be successfully retrained. In 2366, the Zalkonian John Doe used these devices to rehabilitate his injured muscles following the reattachment of one of his arms; two years later Worf used and rejected them when he was paralyzed from the neck down after an accident.
