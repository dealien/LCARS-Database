MEDICAL: Depressurization

The effects of depressurization begin with extreme pressure in the lungs. Extremities get cold and then go numb, and capillaries in some exposed sections of skin may burst. In all, useful consciousness lasts about 15 seconds, followed by 10 seconds of extreme disorientation and then unconsciousness.
