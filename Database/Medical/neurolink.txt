MEDICAL: neurolink

Emergency medical technique employing matching neural pads which is used to stabilize and treat patients with severe brainstem injuries. One pad would be placed on a healthy subject while the matching unit was placed on the injured patient, thereby establishing a link from the healthy autonomic nervous system to the injured system. In 2366, Doctor Beverly Crusher used such a link between the healthy Geordi La Forge and the injured "John Doe" in order to stabilize the latter's nervous system.
