CHEMISTRY: dekyon
 
A class of particles which travel below light speed. 
The U.S.S. Voyager used a Dekyon beam to open a fissure in the event horizon of a class 3 singularity. 
In 2369 the Enterprise-D crew detected changes in a Dekyon field which proved that they were trapped in a temporal loop.
