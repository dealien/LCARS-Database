TECHNOLOGY: Ballanca's Equation

Mathematical equation.  Jadzia Dax used it as a way to make the station's tractor beam behave as though it were elastic.  The beam would "stretch" a little as it towed, damping out the shock of matching velocities.  Dax used the equation to tractor in the Carabas which was traveling at a high velocity.
