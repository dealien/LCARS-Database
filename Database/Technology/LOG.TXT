TECHNOLOGY: log

Record of activities aboard Federation starships and starbases, recorded for official archives. Logs are kept of command decisions, maintenance intervals, security rounds, scientific monitoring, medical observation, and nearly every other duty served in Starfleet. Individuals often keep personal logs as well, protected for privacy as they wish.
