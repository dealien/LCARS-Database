RECREATION: Malkus Chronicles

Zalkatian artifacts containing tributes to the glory of Malkus the Mighty, accounts of his greatness, and other similar outpourings.  None were discovered until Enterprise NX01 discovered one in pristine condition on the Zalkatian homeworld, Beta Aurigae VII.  The Chronicles contained a record of the reign and overthrow of Malkus, and a warning regarding the Malkus Artifacts.
