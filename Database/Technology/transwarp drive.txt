TECHNOLOGY: transwarp drive

Faster-than-light speed travel capable of producing speeds faster than traditional warp speeds, up to twenty times faster. Transwarp uses conduits of travel to propel vessels through space. 
Federation scientists Experimented with this propulsion system, that if successful would have enabled starships to reach higher speeds with greater efficiency. The system was tested aboard the U.S.S. Excelsior in the 2280s before being deemed a failure and abandoned. It is a successful transportation device used by the Borg. The conduits were activated by an encoded tachyon pulse. A Borg ship was first observed using such a device in 2369.
