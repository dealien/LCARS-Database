TECHNOLOGY: aqueduct system

System combining canals and above-ground water conduits to provide fresh water to inhabited communities. Parts of Bajor used aqueducts to supply water for drinking, sanitation, and agriculture. In 2369, Captain Picard of the U.S.S. Enterprise NCC-1701-D attended a conference on management of aqueduct systems during a visit by the starship to Deep Space Nine. Lieutenant Commander Data attacked the system on Tau Cygna V when the colonists refused to leave and allow for Sheliak colonists to take over.
