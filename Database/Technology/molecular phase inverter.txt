TECHNOLOGY: molecular phase inverter

Romulan invention that altered the molecular structure of matter, enabling that matter to pass or phase through normal matter and energy. This energy was incorporated into a type of cloaking device, called a phase cloak, and incorporated into select vessels- mostly those used by the Tal Shiar. The Federation also developed something along these lines and tested it on the U.S.S. Pegasus several years sooner with disastrous results.
