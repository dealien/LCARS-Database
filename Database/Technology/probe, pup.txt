PROBES: "Pup"

A probe of unknown origin but composed mostly of a corundium alloy emerged from the Bajoran wormhole on stardate 46925 near Deep Space Nine, carrying within its databanks a non-biological lifeform later nicknamed "Pup" by Chief O'Brien and Dax when it revealed a pattern of seeking "attention" via computer activity whenever it caused a power outage. The probe itself, scanned from 500 meters off the station, had an extensive computer array but no outward contact signal, no known subprocessor patterns, science modules or comm systems - but had enough computer capacity to run a Galaxy-class starship.
