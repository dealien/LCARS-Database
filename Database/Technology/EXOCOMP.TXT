TECHNOLOGY: exocomp

Experimental apparatus created by Dr. Farallon to perform engineering functions in hazardous situations. Exocomps were equipped with microreplicators that they would use to make whatever tool was needed to accomplish the assigned task. Outfitted with extensive onboard intelligence so they could make repair decisions independently, the exocomps were discovered to be sentient life-forms in their own right in 2369.

The exocomps, designed by Rick Sternbach, were inspired by the character Nammo from the animated s-f series The Dirty Pair.
