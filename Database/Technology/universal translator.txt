TECHNOLOGY: universal translator

Device for translation of spoken languages in real-time communication. It operates by scanning brain-wave frequencies and using the results to create a basis for translation. Captain Kirk used a handheld translator to communicate with the Companion in 2267. The computers of the U.S.S. Enterprise-D have translator capabilities built into its system software.
