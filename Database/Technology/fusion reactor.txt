TECHNOLOGY: fusion reactor

An energy source duplicating the energy creation effect of a star by merging atoms into one and harnessing the escaping energy. In many cases the electroplasma is funneled into the same conduits used by the warp engine energy and are engaged when the warp drives are offline. In other cases fusion reactors can be dedicated to specific uses like to operate impulse drives. When supplying energy to a starship it is considered auxilliary power, while main power is coming from the warp supply.
Fusion engines succeeded fission reactors (those that split atoms) and were much less harmful and created fewer by-products. Fusion reactors were succeeded by warp engines.
