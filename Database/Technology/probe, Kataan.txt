PROBES: Kataan

A small automated probe which apparently had been launched during the same time as Earth's 14th century from Kataan shortly before its star went nova. It was encountered in 2368 by the Galaxy-class U.S.S. Enterprise and downloaded its historical record via a link to the mind of Captain Jean-Luc Picard, who experienced the culture firsthand over a native's lifetime compressed to just 20 real minutes.
