TECHNOLOGY: mooring clamps

Mechanisms used at space stations like Deep Space Nine to hold docked ships in place at their assigned docking ports. Attempting to remove a vessel while the clamps were still engaged led to serious damage to the vessel, so the clamps could also by used by security efforts to prevent a suspect from escaping.
