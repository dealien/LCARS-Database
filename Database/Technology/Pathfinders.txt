TECHNOLOGY: Pathfinders

Federation designation for the twelve synthetic consciousnesses discovered by 2269. They are fond of playing games and have calculated the value of pi, determined the Universe to be a living organism, unravelled the true theory of warp travel, and discovered the Tkon Empire amongst other accomplishments. See: Living Universe Theory   The Worlds Court determined that to own a synthetic consciousness was slavery in 2161. The Federation signed elaborate contracts with them to hire them for work. Their contracts forbid linking to any outside sources except the interface team. The Pathfinders were then installed in the University of New Beijing. New contracts were signed in 2269 and the Pathfinders were moved to Memory Prime. See: Datawell, Transition.
