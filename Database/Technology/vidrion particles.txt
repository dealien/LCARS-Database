CHEMISTRY: Vidrion Particles

Energetic particles that had not been discovered by the United Federation of Planets or any other interstellar civilization in the Milky Way Galaxy before 2333. The Kelvans and the Nuyyad knew about them, but the Kelvans considered them to be too unstable to be harnessed as direct energy. The Nuyyad employed them in their particle cannons.
