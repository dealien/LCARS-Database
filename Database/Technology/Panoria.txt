MEDICAL: Panoria

A debilitating disease that effects Edeman and two other alien races. While most Edemians are immune to the disease, 30 % are not. Panoria is a viral condition whose short-term effects include malaise, easy exhaustion, elevated pulse rate and aches and pains. If left untreated, the disease will cause gradual shutdown of the entire metabolic process in less than a year. Once this happens, the patient becomes an invalid until his death.  The treatment for panoria is Tricylindine.
