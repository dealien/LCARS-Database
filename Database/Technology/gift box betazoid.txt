TECHNOLOGY: Betazoid gift box

A storage chest used to transfer items in. These boxes included sensors to identify when the intended user was present and would open at that time. It could be programmed with a message or greeting that it could deliver before opening. These gift boxes were recognizable by the animated face on the top panel of the box- from which any messages would be delivered as if it were a talking person.
Lieutenant Commander Deanna Troi was given a Betazoid gift box by her betrothed in-laws before her wedding ceremony.
