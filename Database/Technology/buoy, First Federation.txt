TECHNOLOGY: First Federation buoy

A border marking tool used by the First Federation to indicate the area of their territory. The U.S.S. Enterprise encountered one of these when they explored the border (unknown to them at the time) with this neighboring government. The buoy was able to move and match position with the Starfleet vessel and was seen as a threat and destroyed. That action brought the visit from the Fesarius, the flagship of the First Federation.
