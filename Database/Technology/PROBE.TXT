PROBES: Starfleet

Class-1 sensor Probe
An instrumented torpedo launched from Federation starships for investigation into areas that one might not wish to take the starship. The class-1 probe carries a very wide range of scientific sensing equipment.

class-4 probe
A self-contained scientifically instrumented probe used for remote sensor scans. On stardate 46853, a class-4 probe was sent to study an anomalous subspace disturbance near Deep Space Nine. 

class-5 probe
This medium-range probe is used for reconnaissance. Enterprise-D launched a class-5 probe to check out a Cardassian research facility that was supposedly located on Celtris III. 

class-8 probe
A probe designed for extended flight at high warp speeds, usually instrumented heavily with sensor equipment, it is similar in appearance and shape to a photon torpedo. Not specifically designed to fit a person, it was a class-8 probe in which Special Federation Envoy K'Ehleyr arrived on board the Galaxy-class U.S.S. Enterprise on stardate 42901.3.
