RECREATION: Holosuite Program XXX-3

Holosuite program belonging to Quark. The program was set in a large and elaborately decorated tent that contained a great table laid out with all types of food. The program contained images of Jadzia Dax and Kira Nerys dressed as veiled belly dancers who would strip off their multi-colored clothing.  Under duress by Dr. Bashir, Quark was forced to delete this program as well as others that contained images of Deep Space Nine personnel. 

Reference: The Siege
Quark would try to obtain a holoimage of Kira a few years later in the TV episode "Meridian". While in 2369, he used medical records to obtain the knowledge, a mere 2 years later, he went the direct route and tried to use a holocamera. Either Quark was in a hurry (which he was, with a customer breathing down his back) or he was afraid that Bashir would realize what he was up to. (Again possible)
