TECHNOLOGY: matter/antimatter reaction chamber

Abbreviated as M/ARC, or referred to as M/ARA. The actual intermix chamber at the heart of a warp propulsion system, as designed in Federation vessels, where matter and antimatter are safely allowed to react in the most efficient manner. The residual energy, regulated by a dilithium matrix and a series of warp field coils, then creates a subsapce field about the vessel for faster-than-light travel. The use of antimatter requires than a series of safety interlocks and magnetic fields protect the entire warp core. Because of the extreme danger presented by the warp core there are emergency procedures designed to jetison the entire core and all antimatter storage pods before they could explode and damage the vessel.
