PROBES: Cetacean

A large probe sent by an unknown alien race to investigate a lack of communication from Humpback whales on Earth. The probe sent a message on a carrier wave of such intense energy that it neutralized starships, stations, and bases that came near it. The probe traveled to Earth and orbited the planet, trying to contact the whale population. The probe caused Spacedock and all orbiting ships and stations to lose primary and secondary power- resorting to battery backups. The probe ionized the planetary atmosphere, steaming up the skies with high humidity and dense cloud and fog cover. This density blocked planetary solar stations from acquiring new power and caused planet-based facilities to rely on battery power as well.
