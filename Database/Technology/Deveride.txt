FOOD: Deveride

An organic substance that is chewed on Bajor for pleasure, much like Terran bubble gum. Once deveride interacts with the enzymes of the mouth, it completely dissolves after two hours.  Keiko O’Brien found crystallized deveride on the bomb that was planted in the Okana Shipyards, thus proving that it was set recently.
