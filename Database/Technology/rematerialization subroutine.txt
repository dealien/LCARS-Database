TECHNOLOGY: rematerialization subroutine

Part of the operating program of a transporter. This subroutine controls the reintegration of transported subjects. In 2295 Captain Scott used a transporter aboard the U.S.S. Jenolen to suspend himself and crewman Matt Franklin alive in suspension within the transporter until rescue arrived. As part of that process Captain Scott disabled the rematerialization subroutine.
