TECHNOLOGY: Rath

Machine that banished the Furies from their home space. For many centuries it stayed in the vicinity of the Furies' central planet. It became a symbol of doom and evil, bad things were attributed to it, until it was discovered that it was only a piece of technology. It used time as a dimension to allow inter-dimensional travel, enabling the Furies to cover a distance nearly equal to the galaxy's diameter. The name Rath is an Old English derivative of the Gaelic word "rathe", meaning "early", as well as an ancient Irish word meaning "earthwork", "hill" oder "fortress".
