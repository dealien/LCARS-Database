MEDICAL: Steinman analysis

Medical test noting individual-specific data such as voice analysis and particularly brain wave patterns. On stardate 5725, U.S.S. Enterprise NCC-1701 Lieutenant Mira Romaine was given a standard Steinman analysis by chief medical officer Leonard McCoy while under the influence of the Zetarians. The analysis indicated clearly that her brain wave patterns had been altered from her original patterns and now matched the patterns emitted by the Zetarians within her.
