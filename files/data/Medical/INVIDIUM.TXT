MEDICAL: invidium

This highly reactive substance was used in medical containment fields in the 23rd century. The substance is not detectable by a starships internal sensors, as well as being somewhat unstable. Invidium may cause spontaneous nucleosynthesis with the proper catalyzing agents, and is rendered inert through contact with cryonetrium.
