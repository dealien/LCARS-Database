MEDICAL: Cordrazine

A potent stimulant, use in Starfleet medical practice since at least the 2260s. A treatment of 25cc is considered to be a deadly dosage and usually used only as a last resort in life-threatening situations. Doctor Crusher used 25ccs in an attempt to revive Lieutenant Worf during a cardiac arrest. Doctor Bashir used 2ccs to stimulate falling neurotransmitter levels in Bajoran Vedek Bariel, but was not successful. Bashir also used it as a stimulant on quickened Teplanites in 4mg doses, but it soon begins to lose its effect. Ensign Kim of the U.S.S. Voyager was given 2cc of cordrazine when he returned to the vessel from the Vhnori dimension. Doctor McCoy of the U.S.S. Enterprise received a deadly dose of cordrazine in 2367, causing madness and hallucinations. The EMH Doctor ordered 50 mg when Tuvok went into convulsions under a mindmeld.
