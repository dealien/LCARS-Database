MEDICAL: Kalla-Nohra syndrome

A disease whose only known cases resulted from a mining accident at the Gallitepp forced labor camp for Bajorans, sometime prior to its liberation in 2358. Dr. Bashir did not hear of it until Marritza's case in 2369; it may resemble Pottrik syndrome and utilize the same medication. A diagnosis can be confirmed when a lower pulmonary bio-probe shows negative.
