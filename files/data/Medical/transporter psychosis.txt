MEDICAL: transporter psychosis

First diagnosed in 2209 by researchers on the planet Delinia II, this extremely rare medical disorder is induced by a breakdown of neurochemical molecules during transport. The disorder was known to affect bodily motor functions, the autonomic systems and even the higher brain functions. Symptoms and manifestations of the disorder experienced by victims included paranoid delusions, multi-infarct dementia, tactile and visual hallucinations, and psychogenic hysteria. Other peripheral symptoms involved sleeplessness, accelerated heart rate, myopia, muscular spasms, and dehydration. Although Lieutenant Reginald Barclay's fear of transporting led him to believe that he was suffering from this rare disorder, the problem was actually eliminated 50 years earlier, around 2319 due to the development of the multiplex pattern buffer.
