MEDICAL: Borathium

An experimental rybo-therapy "decades ahead" of standard treatment for neural metaphasic shock in 2368, according to Dr. Toby Russell, who used it in vain aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise on a survivor from the crash-landed U.S.S. Denver when she thought it was his only chance. The patient's death angered Dr. Crusher, who relieved her of duty; Russell had said she'd had good results with the drug.
