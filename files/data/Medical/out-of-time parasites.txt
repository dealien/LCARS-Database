MEDICAL: out-of-time parasites

Organisms that are from a domain that exists outside of normal space-time. Captain Archer was infected with these, preventing him from forming any new long-term memories. Twelve years later, T'Pol and Phlox figured out a way to eradicate the parasites, thereby eliminating them from the timeline altogether.
