MEDICAL: neural metaphasic shock

A potentially and often fatal failure of the entire neurological system in a humanoid. Neural metaphasic shock was found to be the cause of death of a crash victim from the Yorkshire-class U.S.S. Denver NCC-54927. This death did not directly follow the crash, but occurred only after Doctor Toby Russell treated him with borathium, an unauthorized drug.
