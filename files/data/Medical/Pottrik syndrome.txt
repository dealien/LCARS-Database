MEDICAL: Pottrik syndrome

A disease (pronounced "POT-rick") that Marritza, seeking to spark suspicion that he really is Gul Darhe'el, claims to be afflicted with rather than Kalla-Nohra syndrome, which he says is treated with the same medication -- though that again may be misdirection. A lower pulmonary bio-probe would have to be negative to indicate Pottrik.
