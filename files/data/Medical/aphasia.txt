MEDICAL: aphasia

Nominally a perceptual dysfunction in which aural and visual stimuli, as well as other communication and comprehension function, are incorrectly processed by the brain. Typically aphasia is associated with cranial trauma, such as a stroke or severe blow to the head, but there are no spontaneous afflictions on record. Space station Deep Space Nine was accidentally infected by an aphasia-like virus in 2369, intended as a sabotage effort against the Cardassian occupation.
