MEDICAL: hyperzine

Stimulant used in Starfleet practice that was administered in at least two 20cc doses for Garak's seizures when his shut-down cranial implant stopped triggering the endorphin flow that his body had grown dependent on. When his body did not respond, Dr. Bashir used a cardio-stimulator with success.
