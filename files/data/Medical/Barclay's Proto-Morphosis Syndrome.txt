MEDICAL: Barclay`s Proto-Morphosis Syndrome

A syndrome where intron release causes a de-evolution within a patient's DNA. The virus is caused by the invasion of genetic codes by synthetic T-cells, and was named for Lieutenant (j.g.) Reginald Barclay of the U.S.S. Enterprise NCC-1701-D in 2370 as its progenitor.
