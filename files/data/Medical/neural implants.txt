MEDICAL: neural implants

One of the elements that, when combined with others, allows the sightless U.S.S. Enterprise NCC-1701-D's Engineer to see. The neural implants function as the bioelectrical interface between Chief Engineer Geordi LaForge's visual cortex and his VISOR. They consist of two bilateral implants in the temporal regions of La Forge's skull and feed directly into the visual cortex. A portion of the implants must remain external to allow for the direct connection of the VISOR to Chief Engineer La Forge's head.
