MEDICAL: Levodian flu

A virus whose infectious cycle takes 29 hours to complete. U.S.S. Voyager's Emergency Medical Hologram infected himself with a simulation of such a virus in order to set an example for the crew on how to withstand suffering. He was not able to deal with the flu symptoms himself, and feared he would die when Kes secretly added a few hours to the simulation.
