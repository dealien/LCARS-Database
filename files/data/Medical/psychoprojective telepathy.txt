MEDICAL: psychoprojective telepathy

Literally, the ability to create solid forms from one's mind. Halanans such as Nidell Seyetik have this gift, though they lose control of it during bouts of extreme emotional stress. The energy given off from the Occipital Lobe to sustain the image often leads to unconsciousness and even death if sustained for more than an hour or two. More than one distinct projection may be created.
