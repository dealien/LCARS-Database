MEDICAL: Inoprovalene

A stimulant commonly used in Starfleet. Dr. Crusher injected it by hypospray at Worf's neck at the first sign of problems after his post-operative release from life support in 2368; a fluctuation in his isocortex was met with a 20 cc dose, then 40 cc and finally 75 cc before she switched to 15 cc of chlormydride. In 2366, Crusher ordered 60 cc along with cardiostimulation as among the first treatments for the badly wounded "John Doe" to help raise his autonomic response. The same dose was given to Captain Picard when his cardial implant was fused; a 20-cc dose was given to Dr. Reyga in vain after his sabotaged metaphasic shield test.
