MEDICAL: psychotectic therapy

A psychological treatment used on the J'naii planet to "treat" or to effectively eliminate gender-specific sexuality, a quality which is judged a fall-back to an earlier, less-evolved time. The J'naii considered gender-specificity aberrant behavior, an illness in need of a cure. This therapy was completely effective in extinguishing Soren's female-specific feelings, despite Soren's objections to receiving the treatment.
