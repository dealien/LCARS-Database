FOOD: Alterian chowder

A seafood soup offered on the Quark's menu in mid-2370, when Sisko once abortively ordered it with uttaberry crepes. 
Neelix- "Quark's may not be recognized as the gourmet hot spot of the Alpha Quadrant, but the Ferengi restauranteur knows how to program a replicator. Take a stroll along the Promenade any afternoon and you'll find patrons from cultures across the quadrants and through the wormhole queuing up to sample the cultural delights Quark has assembled to satisfy his diverse clientele. Even Commander Sisko has his favorites at Quarks, one of which is a creamy soup called Alterian Chowder. This is a smooth vegetarian dish that would tend to be oversweet were it not for the peppery spices Quark programs as a seasoning. You can order your Alterian Chowder spicy hot or mild. It's easy to make in your own kitchen with frozen or canned corn nibblets, cream, some bell peppers and even jalapenos, and butter. Season it with salt and celery seed, or celery salt and, for a walk on the wild side with Tom Paris, a splash of Tabasco.
16 ounces corn kernels
1 cup cream, half-and-half, or whole milk
1/2 green and/or red bell peppers, chopped
1 handful jalapenos, seeded, shopped (optional)
1/8 cup butter
2 teaspoons celery salt or regular salt
2 teaspoons celery seed
Tabasco sauce to taste (optional)
pepper to taste
Blend the corn kernels with cream or milk in your blender or with your hand mixer until you have a chowder. Pour into a medium sized saucepan and add the rest of the ingredients. You can thin the mixture out with more milk or cream, or blend more kernels. Heat on medium for 10 minutes, correcting the seasoning as necessary, and serve; 2 servings.
