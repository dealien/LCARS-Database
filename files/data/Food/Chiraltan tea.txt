FOOD: Chiraltan tea

A beverage (pronounced "chur-ALL-tun") that Sisko orders - with a double twist of lemon - for his first drink of the day the morning after SD 47329.4 - instead of his usual raktajino . 
Neelix- "Chiraltan tea has all the heft and kick of raktajino without the bitter aftertaste you sometimes get when raktajino is left to heat in the pot most of the morning. Good raktajino has to be made fresh, and replicators just don't give you the same blast at the beginning of an early morning watch. The closest equivalent to the smoked flavor ot Chiraltan tea leaves is Tibetan Lapsang souchong tea, the tea of the hidden cities in the Himalayas. The heavy smokiness of the leaves and the rich, rich flavor around the edge makes it a late-night beverage of choice for workaholics, like Sisko, who gets coffeed out during a brutal 26-7 after the invasion of the Alpha Quadrant by the Dominion. As a perfect complement to greenbread or even a hefty dinner, this tea stands up to the flavor. If you wand to drink it Sisko-style, that is, Bajoran-style the way the Emissary likes it, order it with a cinnamon stick; swizzle it around, but take it out before you drink it. Even the Bajorans don't take their cinnamon straight, because the stick gets caught in those little ridges in the bridges of their noses and itches like crazy.
