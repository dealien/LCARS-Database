FOOD: fountain sweets

Drinks dispensed by a fountain, or containing liquids from a fountain style dispenser.
Data and the orphaned Timothy enjoy two fountain-type concoctions-one pinkish, one purplish-in a tall glass with a bent glass straw. The android explains he can analyze but not experience their taste, a limitation of his non-emotional state.
