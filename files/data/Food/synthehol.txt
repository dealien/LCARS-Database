FOOD: synthehol

The generic name for all types of artificial achoholic beverages whose intoxication effect is all illusion and not chemical; synthale is the synthetic version of ale or beer, for example, commonly programmed into Starfleet crew replicators as an alternative to the long-lasting detrimental effects of natural overimbibing. The pleasurable stimulus can be shrugged off at any time, but any potency of liquor is available. Robert Picard groused that his brother's apparent loss of palate came from drinking too much artificial synthehol, but Picard said that it only heightened his appreciation for the real thing.

Here's a drink you can make by using cola syrup, which you can buy from any soft-drink or beer warehouse, and experiment with proportions of sparling water until you get the shade you want. It's supposed to be bourbon-colored, which is a light, almost transparent, brown or amber color. Straight cola is almost the right color, but you have to lighten it by adding more sparkling water. If you can't get cola syrup, try on of the supermarket-brand colas for color and lighten it with club soda or ginger ale. You can also use a very dark apple huice or unfiltered or nonpasteurized apple cider, lightened with water.
