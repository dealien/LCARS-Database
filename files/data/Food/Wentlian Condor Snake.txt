FOOD: Wentlian Condor Snake

Here's a Quark specialty, battered and fried fresh condor snake, served steaming hot. The tastiest (and easiest) replacement for the condor snake on Earth is a standard eel from your fish market of Asian market.
1-2 pounds eel
2 cups cornmeal
1/2 pound fatback
salt and pepper to taste
Slice the el into 2 inch pieces and boil for about 10 minutes in vigorously boiling water. As the eel pieces cook, season the cornmeal with salt and pepper on a flat plate, because that's where you'll be rolling the eel pieces before you fry them. Now heat the fatback in a heavy skillet so that it is reduced to liquid fat. When the eel is tender, remove from water, dry, and roll it in the seasoned cornmeal. Now saute in the pork fat and serve over heavily seasoned rice. Serves 4.
