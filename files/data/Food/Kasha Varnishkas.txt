FOOD: Kasha Varnishkas

1 cup kasha (whole wheat or buckwheat groats)
1 egg or egg white only as a substitute
2 cups beef or vegetable bouillon broth or boiled water
16 ounces bow tie pasta
1/2 medium onion, finely chopped
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 pinch salt or garlic salt

Heat water or bouillon mixture to rolling boil, then keep on low heat at a slow boil. Saute onion in oil until transparent and set aside. Separate egg white from yolk. Stir kasha and egg white into a medium-sized bowl then pour mixture into a heavy saucepan, stirring constantly until the particles separate. Add the bouillon broth or boiling water and salt to taste. Stir the mixture, cover tightly, and reduce heat to simmer for 10 minutes. Cook the bow ties in boiling water until soft, drain and set aside. After the liquid has all been absorbed, mix the kasha with the cooked pasta and sauteed onions and serve. This dish is particularly delicious when served with pot roast gravy. If you want to stay traditionally Vulcan vegetarian, you can make a brown mushroom gravy and use the instead. Serves four.

Reference:
This is my favorite dish. The recipe was handed down by my [Nimoy's] mother, who brought it from her village in the Ukraine, which is a small town in Western Vulcan.
