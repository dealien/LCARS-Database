FOOD: Borg Tricorder Pie

Here a recipe exclusively for the Borg. I call it tricorder pie. Take 10 spent tricorders and crush them with a procto-hammer. Add 1/2 quart plasma oil. Stir. Min in 1 pound of class-4 probe buckling. 1 minced nacelle discharge socket, 1 type 65563-AS9 navigator sensor, and some finely copped bio-neural gel pack casing. Shred in a little PADD hard circuitry and 1 pound of emitter buffer. Season with 1 teaspoon of induction coil and 1/3 ounce of dispersal field matrix. Bake for 3 hours in a destabilized hypo-shield convex warp container. Serve on a bed of transporter room console siding.
