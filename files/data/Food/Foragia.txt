FOOD: Foraiga

The closest thing you'll find to foraiga on Earth are the wonderful edible fungi called truffles. These are such delicacies that most people who like them don't even bother to ask the price. It is sad that in France, the prized black truffle is routed up by pigs; in Italy, the equally priceless white truffle is unearthed by dogs. Whether white or black, the truffle is a rather gamy, intense mushroom-like vegetable with a hard nubbly skin that has to be washed to the point of exfoliation before the food can be used. Truffles are sliced thin, extra thin because of the intensity of their taste, and added near the end of the cooking time for whatever food you're preparing, to avoid overcooking them. Chicken with truffles and rosemary is a delicacy, as are glorious pasta with creamy garlic sauce dishes with black flecks of truffles in the creamy sauce. I like white truffles in a special Italian rice dish called risotto, heavy with cheese and the tang of roma tomatoes.
For an especially easy to prepare truffle dish, you can buy canned or bottled truffles in their own juice, mince a half cup of truffles, put them in a blender on high with a 1/2 cup of dry sherry, chill, and use this for a truffle sauce on poultry or even light meats such as pork.
