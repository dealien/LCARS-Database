This is a pinkish drink that you can make with Gatorade Strawberry Kiwi, pink-lemonade concentrate, or even pink grapefruit juice in bottles or in frozen concentrate. If you want to darken it, use just a touch of Welch's regular grape juice or even one of the darker cranberry juice cocktails or Knudsen unadulterated cranberry juice.
