FOOD: tea, mint

Aromatic tea, with strong qualities that can help stimulate the digestive system.
Picard offered Sarek's second wife Perrin a cup of light-amber mint tea during her visit aboard ship. She says the Vulcans have what they call "mint" but it's not what humans would enjoy. On Deep Space Nine it was Bashir's order at Quark's before Q, disguised as a Bajoran waiter, sent him yawning to bed in 2369.
