CHEMISTRY: salt

Also known as sodium chloride, salt is a common crystalline mineral found on Earth. It is used as a seasoning, and was once used as a food preservative. It is found in a solution within Earth's oceans, and in mineral deposits in various underground cavities. To use the salt on its own many Terrans boiled sea water so that only the salt was remaining. Sea Salt often contains other elements left over when the water was evaporated away, giving it a different taste than traditional ground salt that comes from a mine.
Nimian sea salt is a popular spice in the Federation. Ice salt is an alternative.
In 2266, the shape shifting creature of M-113 craved salt to survive and could kill at will in order to get its requisite salt. 
Captain Benjamin Sisko tries to use the myriad outcomes represented by simple salt's form when combined with other materials to show how Dax could be a totally separate person when hosted by hosts Curzon and Jadzia.
