FOOD: Gamzian wine

Intoxicating beverage (pronounced "GAMM-zee-un") in stock at Quark's on DS9. Quark had some when haggling with Vash about her upcoming auction and glowing geode artifact. Despite its nature, Sisko once ordered the yellow-colored beverage served in a short glass. And con artists Alsia and Martus Mazur shared a glass at Quark's. 

Reference: Rivals 
This heavily intoxicating beverage is really plum juice or plum nectar. To darken it, mix mostly plum juice with just a smidgen of prune juice to darken it, and serve it in small glasses, not large ones. Plum juice or nectar and prune juice make a drink that's nice and thick, just the kind of beverage you'd want to serve if someone as mysterious, as exotically beautiful, and as intriguing as Vash sat down across from you at Quark's and tried to get you to reveal your secrets of archeological finds in the galaxy.
