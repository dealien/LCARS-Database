FOOD: tea

Used both to describe the beverage and the leaf that it is derived from, tea has been a popular Earth drink for over four and a half thousand years.  It is most often made by infusing the dried tea leaves in hot water. Some of the various varieties include Earl Grey, ginger, lapsang suchong, lemon, and mint. 
Teas are also found on other planets using similar techniques of infusing leaves, fruits, or roots with water or other liquids.  Some of these teas include: Andonian, Cardassian red leaf, Chiraltan, Deka, Earl Grey, ginger, Jestral, Kenomay, lapsang suchong, lemon, Mareuvian, mint, Pyrellian ginger, Takana root, Tarkalean, Vulcan spice, and Zariphean blend.
 A jumja tea was even present in the alternate universe.
