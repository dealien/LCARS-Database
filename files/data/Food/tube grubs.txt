FOOD: tube grubs

The Ferengi favorite, served live, is also Nog's. Sisko's is the only place on Earth that can get them, but Joseph considered adding them to the menu with a remoulade -- cooked, of course. 
Neelix- "The Ferengi, like the Klingons, enjoy their share of living organisms as a snack or light meal. Tube grubs are one of their favorites. You can make this at home in your own replicators by getting nice fresh squid or octopus from your Asian market and slicing it real thin over packaged udon noodles that you've chilled and tossed with soy sauce and sesame salad dressing or tahini.
