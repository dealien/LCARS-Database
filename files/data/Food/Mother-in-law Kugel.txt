FOOD: Mother-in-law Kugel

This is a real old-country recipe for noodle pudding, the kind great-grandparents used to make for the holidays. You can serve it as a dessert with sugar and applesauce topping, or with a sour cream or yogurt topping, as a lunch or late breakfast.

1 16-ounce package wide egg noodles
4 eggs
1 pound cottage cheese
1 pound sour cream
1/2 cup (1 stick) butter
1/4 cup milk
2 tablespoon cinnamon
1 tablespoon sugar
TOPPING
2 cups cornflakes
3 tablespoons sugar
3 tablespoons cinnamon
applesauce, yogurt, or sour cream to taste

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Cook noodles al dente, per package instructions, and drain. Then, beat the eggs and fold them into the cooked noodles. In a separate bowl add the cottage cheese, sour cream, butter, milk, cinnamon, and sugar together, mix thoroughly, and then combine with noodle and egg mixture. Pour into rectangular (lasagna-style) baking dish that has been prebuttered so your noodle kugel won't stick. Now for the topping, crush and crumble the cornflakes in a bowl and mix with sugar and cinnamon. Sprinkle topping evenly to cover the noodle mixture. Bake at 350 degrees for 1 hour and serve with applesauce, yogurt, or sour cream. Serves six to eight.
