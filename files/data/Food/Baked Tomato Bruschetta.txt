FOOD: Baked Tomato Bruschetta

This may sound too simple to be true, but I [Rene Auberjonois] guarantee it's a knockout appetizer, hors d'oeuvre, or just plain snack. I'm telling you, people go crazy for this stuff. they think you're a genius, especially when you tell them it's a vegetarian version of Klingon heart of baby targ.
1 loaf crusty Italian white bread
1 dozen Roma tomatoes, cut in half, stems removed
2 or 3 cloves garlic, sliced
2 cups olive oil
1 tablespoon ground red pepper
1 teaspoon basil, minced or dried crushed
salt and pepper to taste
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. After tomatoes have been sliced in ahlf and laid out cut-side up on a flat, lightly oiled baking tray, mix the garlic with the olive oil and stir. Let it sit for at least 15 minutes. Split the bread in half lengthwise. Spoon the olive-garlic mixture over the tomatoes (at least 1 tablespoon per tomato) and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Bake the tomatoes on the upper oven shelf for 15-20 minutes, until they are completely roasted- almost unrecognizable as tomatoes- and have the consistency of jam. Then sprinkle them with basil. At the same time bake the bread until it's hot and toasted, but not burnt. Remove bread from oven, cut into bite-sized chunks, and serve alongside the tomatoes. Let your guests spread the jam-like roasted garlic tomatoes on individual pieces of bread and sprinkle with pepper. Serve with red Italian wine or Klingon bloodwine. Serves six.
