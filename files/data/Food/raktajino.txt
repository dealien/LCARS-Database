FOOD: raktajino

Klingon coffee. Starfleet officers such as Lieutenant Tom Paris and Captain Benjamin Sisko are known to be found of raktajino. 
Neelix says Raktajino is not some wimpy coffee you can buy in a can; it's real java, aged java you can make even more robust and vigorous by mixing with dark French roast or Italian espresso beans that you grind yourself. Vary the proportions of dark roast to java for taste and strength. You can prepare it in your drip coffeemaker or, for a jolt of raktajino power right through your bionic neural network, in your French plunger coffee carafe. You can also do something really crazy and look for a vacuum coffeemaker. Some of them are still around, especially at secondhand stores, flea markets, and swap meats. Follow the package directions for grinding your coffee really fine and for preparing the brew. Vacuum coffee is interesting because it captures the real essence of the coffee. But it's easy to ruin, and once the seals between the top and bottom vacuum bulbs wear out, the coffeemaker no longer has the pressure to force the flavor out of the grind. So don't be afraid to experiment with different blends- java, mocha java, a dark French or Italian roast- and with different coffeemakers.
