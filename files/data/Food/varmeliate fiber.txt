FOOD: varmeliate fiber

One of the foodstuffs taken on by Neelix at Napinne. One of the main ingredients in Talaxian turnip stew.
Plucked from the wintry tundra of Northern Talax, this peasant staple is a strongly flavored, earthy standard. I throw in the greens and combine them with other veggies in Lonian Lamb broth (Lonian lanb is not an animal, but a stalk that secretes a palogideous fat that is remarkably similar to the juices from cooked Sitorian sheep).
Simple stewed turnips in broth will suffice to tempt even the most stubborn of eaters.
