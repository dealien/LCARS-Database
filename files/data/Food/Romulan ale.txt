FOOD: Romulan ale

An infamous blue alchoholic beverage banned in the United Federation of Planets since before 2285 was still not a commonly known commodity; it was unavailable even for replication aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise-D in 2366, to defecting Romulan Adm. Jarok's dismay.. A shipment hijacked by Fallit Kot ca. AD 2362 landed him eight years in a Romulan labor camp after middleman Quark turned on him. 
Doctor Leonard McCoy knew of a merchant that would smuggle the liquid across the border for him, for "medicinal purposes." He gave a bottle of it to his friend Admiral James Kirk for his birthday. Kirk, also fond of the drink, managed to keep a supply aboard his vessel, the U.S.S. Enterprise-A, which he had brought out for the reception dinner with Chancellor Gorkon. He and the crew consumed too much and he made a new standing order, Romulan ale no longer to be served at diplomatic functions. His consumption that evening turned out to be a material fact in his trial on Qo'noS for the murder of Gorkon.
