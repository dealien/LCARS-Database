FOOD: Hatana

Here's a Taresian dish that Harry Kim liked, so I served it to Kes, who also became fond of it. I came to find out, mainly from Harry, who had a very close relationship with the Taresians, that yams, the basis for hatana, are a very healthy food for women. I wanted my Kes to be nothing by healthy- well, healthy and faithful.

4 medium-sized yams, scrubbed and cut in half
1/2 cup (1 stick) butter
6 tablespoons (3/4 stick) melted butter
1 teaspoon cinnamon
4 tablespoons cinnamon
1 teaspoon allspice
1 teaspoon nutmeg
1 teaspoon cardamom

Preheat oven to 375 degrees and bake yams in a shallow baking pan for at least 45 minutes. Add 1/2 cup butter and test yams for doneness, then bake as needed for another 10 to 15 minutes. Alternatively, you can cook your yams in a microwave on high for 10 minutes. Then rotate, add melted butter, and cook for another 5. Test for doneness.
Lightly mash the yams and their skins with a fork, adding remaining butter, cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg, and cardamom. Sprinkle with 4 tablespoons of cinnamon as a topping. Serves 4.
