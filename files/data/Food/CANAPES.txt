FOOD: canapes

O'Brien once made a batch for his cheer-up romantic evening with the bored Keiko on DS9 - though whether home-made or replicated is not specified. At Quark's brief rival Club Martus, Rom didn't trust his brother to avoid the temptation of sabotage and ran a tricorder over a gift tray of food, apparently canapes. Picard finally won over Adm. Nechayev with some Bularian canapes.
