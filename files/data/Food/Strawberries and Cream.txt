FOOD: Strawberries and Cream

1 pound fresh strawberries
1 cup light cream
1 teaspoon sugar
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract

You begin with the freshest strawberries you can find, whether in your own garden or somewhere out there in the Delta Quadrant with the Kazon or the Krenim hot on your tail. If you're preparing this breakfast for your captain or someone else you love, you check each berry for green spots, mold, or a happy little worm or slug that's using it as a temporary residence. Once you've culled any less-than-perfect fruit, gently run water over them to clean; then rinse them again, squeezing them slightly into a bowl, then drop into the bowl. When your done, you'll have a kind of strawberry soup. The trick is to then drizzle the strawberries with the sugar and set them aside for just a little while to let the flavors blend. You will create a light strawberry syrup, which will not only preserve the berries, but will also enhance their flavor. You can't let them sit for more than two days, however, or else the sugar will begin to ferment.
To prepare, ladle a heaping portion of berries into a medium-sized bowl, mash them down just a little to release some of their nectar, mix cream and vanilla, completely cover the mixture, stir, and serve with love. Serves for to six.
