FOOD: Moba fruit

Here's an exotic Bajoran fruit delicacy that Dax says tickles her taste buds. I've looked around for something to replace it, but the best I could come up with is a kiwi, a sweet and tangy little fruit with a very fuzzy skin. Slice it really thin and serve it with jumja tea or even Earl Grey. You can also add some kiwi as moba fruit to a dessert that Jadzia liked called Citrus Blend.
