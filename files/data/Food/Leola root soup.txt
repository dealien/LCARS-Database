FOOD: Leola root 

A legume used for a variety of entrees on the U.S.S. Voyager. Crewman Neelix used it in soups and stews too often.
The soup entree made by Neelix for Lon Suder just before Kazon final attack on ship, using the infamous root. As a variation, Neelix also once stewed the Leola root in a light herbal broth for a few hours; the mildew isn't even noticeable. 
Paris and Kim grew so hungry in the Akritirian prison they imagined they could even eat Neelix's dreaded bane of the Mess Hall.
