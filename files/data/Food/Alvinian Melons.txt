FOOD: Alvinian Melons

You can find these green-flesh melons on Earth as well as on Bajor, where they are among the favorites of Major Kira. On Earth, they're called honeydews, and you can serve them plain, with a dash of lemon juice, with a nice scoop of ice cream, or as an accompaniment to jumja tea.
