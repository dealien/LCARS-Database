FOOD: Quick Red Sauce Primavera

The trick is to combine fresh pasta with microwaved frozen vegetables for a primavera sauce that's quick and convenient. I also use a packaged meatless red marinara sauce, the refrigerated kind rather than jarred, because it's fresher. Rigatoni is my logical pasta of choice because it stands up to the meld of crisp vegetables and tomato sauce. Perfect for a dinner for 1 or two people.

16 ounces rigatoni pasta, cooked al dente
8 ounces refrigerated fresh marinara sauce
2 cups, approximately, combination frozen broccoli, peppers, cauliflower, green beans, and baby peas
1 teaspoon butter
1/2 teaspoon garlic salt and celery salt
ground black pepper
grated Romano or Pecorino cheese to taste

Boil and drain the rigatoni. Stir through garlic and celery salts with butter and let stand while you heat the marinara sauce to a slow simmer.
Place the vegetables in a large bowl, add 2 tablespoons of water, stir, and microwave on high for approximately 2 1/2 minutes, stir, and microwave on high for another 1 1/2 minutes.
Stir the vegetables through the pasta; top lightly with marinara sauce and cheese(s). Serve immediately.
