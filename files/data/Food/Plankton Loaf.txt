FOOD: Plankton Loaf

Miles was a meat-and-potatoes man, but his new bride, Keiko, was strictly vegetarian. Try as she might to get used to Miles' love of meat, she could not. But Keiko had another idea. Maybe she could wean Miles away from his hard-eating ways and lure him over to the world of vegetarian. Since Miles liked his bread- every hardworking man does, you know- she figured that she might be able to awaken the subtleties of his taste buds by creating a totally vegetarian bread. Since she liked what plankton did for the food chain, she figured she'' start with it for her new husband. Hence, plankton loaf, as created by Keiko O'Brien.
Miles tried his best, but he hated it, and his disappointment was etched all over his face. Keiko should have tried this version of plankton loaf, made with zucchini, infused green tea leaves, and a touch of seaweed, that I intend to serve at tea. Use this recipe in your automatic bread maker.

1 3/4 cups bread flour
1/2 cup whole-wheat flour
1 teaspoon dry active yeast
1 cup finely chopped zucchini
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup lung jing or shou-mei warm green tea
1/4 cup infused tea leaves
1 tablespoon finely chopped seaweed (dried or roasted)
1 teaspoon sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger

Follow your bread machine's directions for adding ingredients to the hopper, and after the baking sequence has begun, add one nice leaf on top for decoration.
