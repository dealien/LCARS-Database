FOOD: Stardrifter

A green beverage served at Quark's in a short glass -- and apparently intoxicating, since Kira orders a double during the stalled Paqu-Novat border talks. 

Reference: The Storyteller 
Here's a Ferengi drink Quark served at the bar that, believe it or not, allows you a variety of colors to mix. As a base, you can use either Alpine Snow or the clear lemon-lime Gatorade topepd with straight-off-the-shelf blueberry pancake cyrup. Instead of the Alpine Snow, you can use any orangeade or orangeade concentrate topped with blueberry pancake syrup, grape drink syrup, or cherry syrup. You can even mix lime or lemon-lime syrup with sparkling water and drop cherry syrup on top.
For any stardrifter drinks you can also use this trick: you can have a smaller glass within your larger glass- use plastic, not real glass- with two different liquids. For example, you can have Welch's grape juice in the inner glass and Gatorade orage in the outer glass. You serve these with a double straw, the Y-shpaed clear plastic straws you get from party stores that are supposed to be used when people share the same drink. But for a stardrifter reverse the straw so that one end of the Y is in the grape juice and the other end is in the orange drink. When you or your guests drink from the single straw they'll actually be drawing two differently colored liquids through the bottom of the straw's branches that mix when the branches meet. If you can find these straws, it's a great special effect you can create in your own home.
