FOOD: Saurian brandy

The long-time favorite alcohol served in its crook-necked bottle was a favortie among Starfleet crews by the 2260s. It made up 87 percent of the green drink Guinan heard about on Prakal II and tries out on Data a century later. On DS9, Quark stocks it and coolly offers some to go for Bashir while lying about Garak's request for a spy implant's replacement. Quark also ordered some for his business meeting with Emi to seal their deal. Odo once confiscated a bottle from a Yridian smuggler and later shared it with Dax. 

Reference:
The distinctive curved-neck bottles of this liquor provided quite a decorative touch at Quark's, even though anybody that drank this stuff knew in a minute that it was a valuable, highly-prized brew. The bottle is a commemorative design from the Dickel Company of Tennessee. Like Earth brandies from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Saurian brandy was a commodity as well as an exquisite pleasure. The gold, nut-like color of Saurian brandy is best captured by O'Doul's nonalcoholic beer. You can use other nonalcoholic beers as well. These have a strong taste and a moderate head, but the color's just right.
