FOOD: soup, Romulan

Often served in clear bowls, Romulan soup is a common dish on Romulus. 
On the recommendation of their dour waitress, Lieutenant Commander Data and Captain Jean-Luc Picard ordered soup when disguised as natives on Romulus in the cafe where they tried to find Senator Pardek. It was distasteful to the captain.
