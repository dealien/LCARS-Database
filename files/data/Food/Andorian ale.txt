FOOD: Andorian ale

Beverage from the blue-skinned Federation member world that is on supply at Quark's in 2370, ordered by Tiron. 

Reference: Meridian 
This is a yellowish nut-like drink that I would concoct by mixing Vernors or Schweppes ginger ale and giving it a head with just a half teaspoon of milk so it looks like an egg cream. You can also use a lemonade concentrate mixed in lighter-than-usual proportions with club soda or ginger ale instead of plain water, and mixed with a half teaspoon of milk and stirred to give it a head.
