FOOD: Maraltian Seev-ale

A light green beverage Quark keeps in his private stock. Odo offered a drink to Major Kira Nerys as she calmed down after being enraged by the apparent "Butcher of Gallitepp" in 2369, but how he got it is not explained. 

Reference: Duet 
From Quark's private stock, this ale has either a strange deep burgundy or purple color or a deep brown nut color. These most interesting colored drinks are created from both Reed's: raspberry-flavored ginger ale or dark ginger beer. Or any of the imported ginger beers or birch beers, especially, have the right color. Serve this drink in the kinds of Asian import mugs you find at Pier 1 or another imported goods store that has a catalogue of exotic-looking glassware or dishware.
