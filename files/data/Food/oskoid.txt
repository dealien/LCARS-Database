FOOD: oskoid

Presumably native to Betazed, a cabbage-like dark yellow leaf with purplish veins. Ambassador Lwaxana Troi offered some to Commander William Riker on her picnic there in 2367; she noted how the sap in the veins helped keep it warm. Two years later Lwaxana ordered it up from an U.S.S. Enterprsie-D food replicator. 
Neelix says that Commander Deanna Troi is also fond of a Betazoid delicacy known as oskoid, a leafy plant similar to red or green romaine lettuce. If you want to impress the Betazoid in your life with an oskoid salad, combine sesame salad dressing or tahini with just a touch of soy sauce and rice vinegar and shake very well.
Arrange leaves of green and red romaine lettuce around a sliced Bermuda onion and pour the dressing over them. No need to toss; just wrap the onion slices in the romaine lettuce leaves and eat it up. If you must, you can squeeze a lemon wedge over the plate to give it a bit more zing, but it tastes great either way.
