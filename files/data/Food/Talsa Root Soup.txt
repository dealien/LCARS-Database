FOOD: Talsa Root Soup

I'd [Neelix] like to take credit for this, but Caylem made Talsa Root Soup for Janeway.

2 cups sliced summer squash or zucchini
8 ounces unsweetened pumpkin for pie filling, blended in a food processor
1/4 cup of water
2 tablespoons light cream
2 tablespoons ground ginger
1 teaspoon ground pepper
salt to taste

While steaming squash in your homemade or store-bought steamer, blend the pumpkin with 1 tablespoon of the light cream in a food processor and then heat in a medium saucepan with 1/4 cup boiling water. Add steamed squash and stir through for 15 minutes. Add ground ginger and pepper, cook for 5 more minutes. Add 1 tablespoon cream, salt, and serve. Serves six.
