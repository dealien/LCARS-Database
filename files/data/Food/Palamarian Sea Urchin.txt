FOOD: Palamarian Seas Urchin

Quark's favorite version of sea urchin sashimi lives on the computerized annals of Starfleet cuisine. You can use regular sea urchin sashimi on Earth, served raw, of course, on beds of lettuce. At your Asian market you can find sea urchin that's tasty and a delightful appetizer when sliced very thin. In many Asian supermarkets, you can find the sea urchin already sliced and ready to arrange on a bed of white rice for individual servings. I would arrange 8 or so pieces for each serving on about a cup of fluffed white rice liberally mixed with sesame seeds and some rice vinegar. Garnish with sliced pickled ginger, also available at any Asian market, and you have an appetizer as well as a delicious lunch.
