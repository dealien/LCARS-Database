FOOD: Alfarian Hair Pasta

Reference:
What Ethan Phillips (Neelix) threw on Robert Duncan McNeill (Tom Paris) was angel-hair pasta, very thin, very quick to cook, and easy to combine with other items to make it look bizarre. It takes so little to make so much that it's a very efficient food prop.
