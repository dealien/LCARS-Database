FOOD: Black Hole

A Ferengi beverage served at Quark's; one version is straight up. One who enjoys it is the Boslic captain who unknowingly brought Li Nalas' earring to Bajor. Dax likes it too after it was introduced to a former host by a bartender it's known for a 100 years. 

Reference: The Homecoming 
Here's a Ferengi drink that is exactly what it says it is. Make this at home with dark espresso coffee sweetened with as much sugar or aspertame as it takes. If you want to carbonate it, chill it and serve over ice mixed with sparkling water, vanilla extract, and sweetener. You can serve it hot or cold.
