FOOD: ale

Hops-based alcoholic beverage. Beverage ordered by the Picard duplicate, unbeknownst to his crew, for himself and then everyone in Ten-Forward before leading a hearty sailors' song. Engineer Duffy once drank a synthehol version of a light Earth ale; that specialty is usually referred to as "synthale."
