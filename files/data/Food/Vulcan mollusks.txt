FOOD: Vulcan mollusks

An edible sea creature native to Vulcan that is noted to many, including Quark. He served an entrée of jumbo Vulcan mollusks sauteed in Rhombolian butter to Fallit Kot who appeared to at least tolerate it. 
Neelix- "Vulcan mollusks, another treat from Quark's, are green mussels served nice and hot with a Rhombolian butter sauce. Begin with 1 dozen or more mussels and plunge them into boiling water seasoned with lots of Old Bay seasoning and pickling spices. When the mussels open they're done. Arrange them around a dish of snail butter for dipping in, with a garnish of watercress for spice, and serve. Serves 2.
