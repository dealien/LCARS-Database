FOOD: Earl Grey Chocolate Cake

If you've developed a taste for the lightly spicy Earl Grey and you like chocolate cake under any conditions, as Commander Troi certainly does, then you can have your cake and drink it, too, with this recipe for dessert and tea at the same time. It's great by itself and, of course, is a perfect snack to accompany your Earl Grey tea.

3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) butter, softened
3/4 cup sugar
3 large eggs
2 tablespoon Earl Grey tea (infused)
3/4 cup sifted, self-rising cake flour
grated rind from 2 oranges

Preheat oven to 350 degrees and grease and line a large loaf pan. Cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs, one at a time, and beat in thoroughly. Add the grated rind, flour, and tea, and fold in with a wooden spoon. Turn the batter into the pan and smooth the top. Bake for 30 to 40 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out clean. Remove from oven and let cool. When cool, score the top lightly in preparation for the icing.

juice from 2 oranges
1/2 cup sugar
2 ounces semisweet chocolate

Gently heat the orange juice and sugar together in a saucepan until the sugar has dissolved. Bring to a boil and boil 1 to 2 minutes. Pour over the cake. When it has soaked in, then you can remove the cake from the tin. In a small saucepan melt the chocolate and pour over the top. You can make patterns with a fork. (A 1/2 teaspoon of infused Earl Grey tea can be added to the chocolate for an added punch.)
