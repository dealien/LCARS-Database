FOOD: Rice Noodles in Milk

Package of rice noodles
Milk (skim, 2%, 1%, 1/2%, whole)
1 pat of butter (optional)
Garlic salt to taste
-or-
Cinnamon to taste

It didn't take me long to figure out that Ensign Kim is more of a nosher than an eater, but he goes for this dish in a big way. The noodles I use are actually slivered and pressed wokky intestines, and the "milk" is sap from the Pyrinthian blacto weed. Mr. Kim is not aware of this. In your galley, you can prepare a 16-ounce package of store-bought rice noodles from the Asian-foods section of your supermarket or any Asian-foods specialty store according to the package instructions. Drain, remove the portion you want to use, then refrigerate the rest.
In a microwavable bowl, add the noodles you want to use, enough milk (skim, reduced fat, or whole) to cover the noodles completely, a small pat of butter (optional), and maybe a dash of garlic salt, and heat on high in your microwave for a minute. Test to see if it is heated through, and if not heat for another 15 seconds, making sure that the milk doesn't boil over or form a skin. You can also serve with cinnamon instead of garlic salt.
