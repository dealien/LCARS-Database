FOOD: Poulet Ferenge

1 1/2 pounds chicken breast, skinned, deboned, white meat, cut into bite size pieces
16 ounces peeled tomatoes
1 Bermuda onion, thinly sliced
1/2 cup thinly sliced olives
12 garlic cloves, crushed
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 teaspoons thyme
1 teaspoon hot chili paste (sambal delek)
2 bay leaves
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1/4 teaspoon saffron threads
1 sprig parsley, chopped

Make sure that you've removed all the skin and pieces of bone from your chicken, and then cut it into easy bite-size pieces. Now brown it in the olive oil in a heavy skillet, making very sure that you don't burn it. Remove from heat just as it browns and place on paper towel to drain the oil from the chicken. Now saute the onion slices in the remaining oil for 5 minutes. When they just begin to turn clear add the garlic and let it brown. Now add the tomatoes, thyme, salt, and pepper, and bring to a simmer for 10 minutes. Add the chicken, chili paste, and bay leaves, and turn the heat back to a slow simmer for 20 minutes. Now add the saffron and the olives, and continue to simmer for 10 minutes. Test chicken for tenderness and doneness. When you're satisfied that it is thoroughly cooked and tender add the parsley, stir through, and serve. Serves four.
