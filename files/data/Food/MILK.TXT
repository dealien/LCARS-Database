FOOD: milk

A white liquid derived from animals (on Earth, usually cows) and used as a nourishing drink. Milk comes from warm blooded mammels and is used by the mother to suckle the young. Terrans extract the milk from farm animals and continue to consume it after their infancy.
A warm milk is Lieutenant Reginald Barclay's real drink of choice in Ten-Forward, according to Guinan. Milk drew Commander Geordi LaForge's scorn, but Guinan recommended it to him straight-faced as a sleep aid. Aboard U.S.S. Voyager, some variety after replication is kept in a storage container for easy access from the cooling unit. 
Another remedy Captain Jean Luc Picard attributed to his Aunt Adelle, steamed milk and ginger is used to cure insomnia. He offered it to Dr. Beverly Crusher the first time she stayed up sleepless with the feeling of deja vu in the temporal loop.
