FOOD: Lemon Chicken

1 pound boneless, skinless, chicken breasts
1 medium-sized lemon
1/4 cup chopped onion
1 cup asparagus or broccoli, chopped into small pieces
1 cup dry white wine
1 teaspoon cornstarch
salt and pepper to taste

Cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces and saute with onion over a medium/high flame in a large heavy saucepan or Dutch oven. After onions begin to turn transparent, squeeze the lemon juice into the mixture and continue to saute. Add salt and pepper to taste. When the chicken has browned, add white wine, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes. Add vegetable pieces, cover, and simmer for an additional 8 minutes or until vegetables are just done. You don't want them too soft. Thicken the sauce mixture by removing 1/2 of cooking liquid to a small bowl and add cornstarch. Stir constantly until fully blended. Then add the cornstarch mixture back to the pan a tablespoon at a time until thickened.
Serve over or alongside Alfarian hair pasta, angel-hair pasta, or rice for a quick lunch or dinner that serves 3.
