FOOD: Potatoes O'Brien

Miles O'Brien didn't invent potatoes O'Brien; they've been around as a way to push yesterday's spuds on the kids long before Miles was ever born. There are plenty of different ways to make this dish; here's the easiest one from the chief's personal log.

3-6 leftover baked potatoes
1 green bell pepper, chopped
1 medium onion chopped
1 cup grated cheddar cheese or more to taste
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon celery seed
1 cup very hot milk
salt and red cayenne pepper or paprika to taste

Preheat over to 350 degrees. Scoop out and chop up the meat from the leftover boiled or baked potatoes. Then, in a large mixing bowl combine the pepper, onions, and celery seed. Mix in the chopped potato. Add the flour, salt, and half the cheese, and stir through. Spoon this mixture into a greased shallow baking dish. Pour the milk over the top, maybe add a pat or two of butter, and sprinkle on the rest of the cheese. Bake at 350 degrees for a 1/2 hour.
