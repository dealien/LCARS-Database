FOOD: Eggplant Casserole

2 pounds small, skinny eggplants, sliced (you can also use Japanese eggplant)
28 ounces crushed tomatoes
1 medium onion, finely chopped
1 cup light olive oil
2 tablespoons chopped parsley or 1 tablespoon dried parsley
salt and pepper to taste

Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Slice eggplant crosswise into half-inch slices. Heat olive oil in a heavy skillet until it just bubbles but doesn't smoke. Fry eggplant in hot oil until nicely browned on both sides. As the oil is absorbed, keep adding more, taking care not to splatter. As each batch of eggplant slices is fried, place them on a plate with paper towels so they can drain. 
When the eggplant is done and is draining, fry the onion in the remaining oil, or add more, over medium heat until the onion is golden brown. Then very slowly (so that it doesn't splatter) add the tomatoes, parsley, salt, and pepper. Simmer for about 5 minutes. Put the eggplant into a casserole dish (13 by 9 inches) in layers. Add the tomato sauce mixture, cover with aluminum foil, and bake at 375 degrees for 45 minutes.
Serve with either a crusty white bread or a dark olive loaf to mop up the delicious sauce. This should be accompanied with a light Greek salad with olives and a hint of feta cheese.
This dish goes very well with either a Soave or Frascati or even a fruity Valpolicella. Serves four to six.

Deanna Troi may be a chocoholic, but [Marina Sirtis] really likes Mediterranean cooking. This eggplant casserole is as authentic as Greek food can be. But don't let the eggplant fool you; this is not a diet dish!
