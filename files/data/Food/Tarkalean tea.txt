FOOD: Tarkalean tea

Amber-brown beverage (pronounced "tar-KAY-lee-un") that is widely popular on DS9 and Bashir's favorite during his first year at the station. It is available at both Quark's and the Replimat, where the doctor was drinking it when Garak first introduced himself; ironically, he drank it over his friend's near-fatal endorphin addiction recovery. Bashir's coma hallucination had the tea steadily pouring from the Replimat replicator. It is now on file in the U.S.S. Defiant's replicators: Bashir ordered some with sweet brescha fruit in the Mess Hall. He likes it extra sweet, but Kira drinks hers not too sweet. 
On Earth this is a lot like a bracing and tart cranberry tea.
Neelix- "You can serve it with lemon, the traditional way, or with a slicer of orange rind. I especially like to float a piece of orange rind in my tea and add a squeeze of lime juice. For a cold night it's very soothing. But try this iced for a summer afternoon or a dessert drink at a picnic.
