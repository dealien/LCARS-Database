FOOD: rice

A common Terran grain, especially of Asia. This food is often considered a staple item in many cultures. It is available in a simple white version as well as "long grain" varieties. White rice is often served in multiple ways including boiled or steamed, and with assorted fried items like chicken fried, pork fried, and shrimp fried; including peices of meat and vegetables with the rice.
Neelix researched and served some with a little fish and replicated ginger seasoning to Japanese officer Nogami of the "'37s." Also, a wild variety of rice was part of Lieutenant Tom Paris' imaginary seven-course meal while in Akritirian prison.
