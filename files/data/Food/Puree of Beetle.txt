FOOD: Puree of Beetle

The Ferengi seem to have a thing for insects. Maybe it's me, but the idea of mashing some winged hard-shelled thing with your fingers, squeezing a bag og green puss for blood, and watching lots of legs that squirm in all directions when you go to eat it doesn't seem like gourmet dining no matter how you serve it. So, although the Ferenge like puree of beetle as a common breakfast food, I can see where humans might have a problem. Short of flattening insects for a morning repast with a hot cup of raktajino, you might try the closest thing to an insect that Earthlings consider a delicacy, with a lobster pate on your toast points. Lobsters are insects too, you know. Can't get any lobster? Try crabmeat or even shrimp. Here's a basic pate recipe for all three of them.
1 to 1 1/2 pounds cooked lobster meat, or lump crabmeat, or boiled, peeled, deveined shrimp
1 cup dry white wine
1/3 cup bread crumbs
2 porcini mushrooms or canned truffles, finely chopped
2 egg yolks
1 tablespoon melted butter
1/2 teaspoon salt
black and/or red pepper to taste
Cut the lobster, crab, or shrimp meat into 1 inch pieces and marinate them in the wine 2 to 3 hours. After the marinating period preheat oven to 350 degrees and combine the meat, wine, bread crumbs and mushrooms or truffles. Beat the egg yolks thoroughly; then stir the egg yolks into the pate mixture. Blend in the melted butter, salt, and pepper. Arrange in a baking dish, cover, and bake for 45 minutes. Remove cover and bake for another 25 minutes, checking the top to make sure it turns crisp and browns lightly but does not burn. Serve over toast. Serves 4.
