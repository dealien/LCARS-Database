FOOD: Calaman sherry

A red beverage that Data joined Jenna D'Sora in ordering during their last real date together, just before the "lover's spat." 

Reference: In Theory 
Here's a blush-colored drink that should look like pink champagne. Strawberry Kiwi is again your base drink of choice, lightened with Martinelli's sparkling apple cider, which also provides effervescence, or straight club soda if you don't want it too sweet. Serve in a tall, long-stemmed champagne glass so you can watch the bubbles rise.
