FOOD: champagne

Champagne is still much-used as a beverage for ceremonial toasts. Champagne is a sparkling white wine made from specific small grapes grown in a small region of France, Earth. While the fruit has been transplanted and grown in greenhouses throughout the planet and Federation- die hard conniseurs insist that champagne may only be made from berries from the localized region. Bottles of champagne are also used to christen naval and space going vessels. The sealed bottle is broken over the hull as a marking for good luck. The commissioning ceremony of the U.S.S. Enterprise-B included such an event.
Captain Jean-Luc Picard offered a toast to former lover Jenice Manheim with it, as did Lieutenant Commander Deanna Troi when she dated Devinoni Ral. Dr. Paul Stubbs tried to brush aside Troi's probing with promises of champagne in New Manhattan on Beth Delta I. Lore slipped Data a mickey in his champagne in an attempt to switch uniforms and identities with him. 
Dr. Julian Bashir tried in vain to tempt Lieutenant Jadzia Dax to a dinner with a dry champagne Quark located for him from an estate bottler on Korris I. Chief Miles O'Brien had some for his cheer-up romantic evening with the newly bored Keiko O'Brien on Deep Space Nine. Bottles were opened in the Wardroom to toast Bashir's Carrington nomination and -- as a special order by Bashir -- for Captain Benjamin Sisko's promotion party, Chateau Cleon 2303. 
Captain Kathryn Janeway asked about champagne after witnessing an historic supernova in the Delta Quadrant on the U.S.S. Voyager.
