FOOD: turkey

Native to North America on Earth, the turkey is a large bird that is a popular dish at holiday times. 
A replicated bird was carved by Captain Jean-Luc Picard as part of a representative buffet of Federation foods for Commander Kurn in 2366, when the Klingon called it "burned replicated bird meat." 
Amid the food preparation methods of the 23rd century, Kirk once asked his galley chief to form reconstituted turkey into its natural shape for Thanksgiving.
