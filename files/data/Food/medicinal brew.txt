FOOD: medicinal brew

A beverage that Quark delivered to Doctor Bashir on the eve of his charity racquetball rematch with Chief O'Brien, supposedly a gift of the monks who worked the Bajoran Fund for Orphans, an "ancient secret of their order" that imparted "great energy and vigor" when swallowed in one gulp. Actually, it's an anesthetic -- Quark's poor attempt to fix the match when all the bets went for Bashir -- and contained water, sucrose, dextrose, tribnel root extract, grain particulates, yeast, synthahol, and nearly 17 mg of hyvroxilated quint-ethyl metacetamin.
