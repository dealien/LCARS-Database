FOOD: Darvot Fritters

I cooked these sweet Janeway favorites shortly after I first joined the crew. It was so long ago I only dimly remember instructing Ensign Parsons to rotate these delectables until they turned a deep chartreuse. Whatever happened to Ensign Parsons? I wonder if he got lost somewhere, maybe in the twisted corridors of Deck 11. But to the point: darvot are fat buttery tulips grown on Nerada. They bloom in the moonlight and their shoots are extremely poisonous- the Neradians tip their torpedo heads with a paste made from darvot shoots and uranium. The flower, however, is rich, dense doughy joy. To make the fritter batter, I mash them with Ubean oat milk and add fushia foam crickets- crickets that dance on the waves that break on the shores of Seyrel, a tacky Sakari resort city. I hope you like them: Captain Janeway does. I've caught her stealing into the mess hall late at night to munch on them with a big glass of Kharma berry milk. Darvot Fritters can be replicated as corn fritters, straight up and simple.

1 cup corn kernels (drained)
1 1/2 cups creamed corn
2 eggs
6 tablespoon bleached all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1 dash salt
1 dash nutmeg
3/4 cup butter

In your blender, food processor, or with your handheld mixer, combine and mix the corn and creamed corn until the mixture looks like a mash. Beat two eggs, as if you were making an omelette and add them to the corn mash. Now add the flour, baking powder, salt and nutmeg. Melt you butter in a hot skillet and spoon in 1-inch drops of the corn fritter batter. Fry until brown on one side, turn and fry on the other side. You can serve them, nice and hot, with blueberries or just plain. Yields approximately eighteen 2-inch fritters.
