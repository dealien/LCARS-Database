FOOD: Q'parol

Keiko's favorite dish is a version of stuffed shells with spinach, featuring ricotta cheese mixed with feta cheese, baked in a casserole and topped with parsley and oregano. I like this with lots of garlic and zipped up with fresh-ground black pepper
1 cup ricotta cheese
16 ounces large pasta shells
2 cups spinach, washed and finely chopped
1 egg, well beaten
4 ounces feta cheese
2 tablespoon oregano
2 tablespoon olive oil
4 cloves garlic, crushed
2 teaspoons dried parsley
salt and pepper to taste
grated Romano or Parmesean cheese to taste
Preheat oven to 325 degrees. While you coko the large shells according to the package's instructions, mix the ricotta and feta cheese with olive oil, spinach, and egg until you have a stiff cheese stuffing. Now crush the cloves of garlic and fold them into the stuffing along with 1 tablespoon of oregano and your salt and pepper. Set this aside in your refrigerator. When shells are done, drain, and stuff them with the filling. Lightly grease an 8 inch glass baking dish with olive oil, and arrange the stuffed shells in the dish. Sprinkle the parsley and the remaining oregano over the top and bake at 325 degrees for 45 minutes, checking after 30 minutes to make sure the shells don't burn. Just as the shells become crisp, remove from oven, sprinkle with your favorite grated Romano or Parmesean cheese, remove from baking dish, and serve. Serves 4.
