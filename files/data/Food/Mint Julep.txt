FOOD: Mint Julep

Leonard McCoy fancied himself to be a Southern gentleman, and his favorite drink was a Southern staple, an ice-cold mint julep. Whether he really believed what he was reputed to have said, "You can't find anyone who knows how to make a real mint julep in this part of the galaxy anymore," or that complaint was simply apocryphal, I can't tell you. I didn't find it in any of the Starfleet logs, but then the logs don't tell you everything either.
Not wanting to corrupt anyone with the real alcoholic mint julep, I present an "essence of julep" in a by-the-glass recipe for your Gone With the Solar Wind get-togethers. It's easy to find the real mint julep, not only in any standard bartender's guide, but in any Junior League cookbook from any locale South of Earth's American capital.

lots of fresh mint sprigs
8 ounces Schweppes, Canada Dry, or Seagram's tonic
1/2 cup confectioner's sugar
1 teaspoon Rose's lime juice
1 dash bitters, such as Angostura brand

Begin by adding three parts of the confectioner's sugar to one part clear cold tap water to make a sugar solution. Coat your mint with the sugar solution by dipping it in, and set aside to dry. Reserve the sugar solution. Chill individual serving glasses in the refrigerator. You can very lightly coat the rims of the glasses you want to chill with the sugar solution to give them a "Jack Frost" appearance, especially appealing for a hot evening mint julep on your porch or verandah. Coat them first, then chill.
Pour tonic water into individual glasses containing ice and slightly rub the mint leaves in your hand before adding them to the drink. Add the lime and bitters to each drink, stir, top off with a sprig of mint, and serve.
