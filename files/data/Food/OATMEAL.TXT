FOOD: oatmeal

Earth porridge made from ground oats. 
The Terran grain mush is known to Cadet Nog, at least since his Deep Space Nine residency; he used it as fake "Odo gel" to tease Varia. Telling Tosk about finally getting the replicators repaired and fine-tuned, Chief Miles O'Brien joked that they finally turned out a decent oatmeal in 2369. It is still a favorite of Jake Sisko's. Oatmeal is also available in ration packs, which Commander Chakotay often remembered from his field excersizes.
