FOOD: Spam-and-Beans Bolognese

When I [Alexander Siddig] was younger- so much younger than today- I was at university, where I used to cook a bastardization of spaghetti Bolognese with beans. It's a British thing. Four ravenous students could easily be fed in 30 short minutes from a single electric burner and all for less than half a pound sterling a head, which, in those days, really meant something. The Spam was easy because it ain't just junk e-mail. The tricky part was getting the spaghetti just right. You can try this in your dorm room as long as you don't tell anyone that Julian Bashir gave you the recipe.
16 ounces Italian plum tomatoes
1 can Spam, cubed
8 ounces baked beans
16 ounces #8 spaghetti
1 teaspoon olive oil
1 pinch oregano
1 pinch parsley
1 pinch basil
garlic, salt, and pepper to taste
Bring water to a boil, add spaghetti, and reduce to slow boil. Cook al dente. Drain in a strainer, mix with a little oil, and set aside. Heat some more olive oil in the speghetti pot, where you will first cube then brown the Spam but not burn it. Set aside. Next, in the same pot, simmer the tomatoes in their juice with the seasonings. When the mixture is fully heated through and seasoned, add the browned Spam and stir through. Next add the beans and stir through, and reseason to taste. Pour over the spaghetti, top with your favorite cheese, bung on a life, and gather around the telly for the latest episode of Deep Space Nine.
