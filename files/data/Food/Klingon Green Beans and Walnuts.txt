FOOD: Klingon Green Beans and Walnuts

You can substitute live worms for green beans. For that extra-special Klingon touch, instead of walnut oil use bloodwine. And remember "bortaS blr jablu'Dl' reH QaQqu' nay'." Translation: "Revenge is a dish that is best served cold."

2 pounds green beans, trimmed
1/4 stick butter
1 cup chopped toasted walnuts
2 tablespoons walnut oil
2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley
salt and pepper to taste
salt for boiling water

Cook beans in a large pot or boiling salted water until just tender, about 5 minutes. Rinse beans with cold water to stop the cooking (I rinse them and then put them in a bowl of ice water). If you want, you can cook the beans in advance, about 6 hours before you serve them. Just be sure to refrigerate them. To complete, put butter wil oil in large heavy skillet over high heat. Add beans and toss until heated through, about 4 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Add walnuts and parsley and toss. Serve in a large bowl garnished with whatever greens you like. The greens also set off the color of the beans. Serves six.
