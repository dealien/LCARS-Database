FOOD: wine

Popular Earth-based alcoholic drink derived from a variety of fermented grapes. On other planets a fruit similar to grapes is usually used. Champagne is a wine made with specific grapes, grown in a specific region of Earth. Sparkling juices are almost wines, but usually have not fermented enough to contain alcohol.
Riker brought down a bottle of wine to share with colonist Carmen Davila at dinner in 2369.
