FOOD: Hasperat

Spicy Bajoran dish resembling a sliced Earth burrito, but filled with a carefully processed brine. A properly prepared hasperat will set one's tongue on fire and bring tears to the eyes. It can also be served as a soufflé, by blending the hasperat and baking it in a deep pan. 
Thinking of Ro Laren and her Bajoran culinary predilictions, she really goes for hasperat, a Bajoran delicacy that was her most favorite food in the universe, in a big way. Ro could polish off a hasperat so quickly it's hard to believe she could stay so thin. But then this Bajoran favorite fast fod can be made with low-calorie cream cheese instead of the heavy cheese you get at the deli. You can use flour tortillas layered with cream cheese into which are pressed fresh green and red pepper slices sans the seeds. For more of a bite, instead of peppers or even along with peppers, press in chopped watercress and cilnatro. This makes for a very robust hasperat. For a softer and even tastier version of hasperat, forget the watercress or cilantro and simply roast red and green pepper slices very lightly in olive oil or canola oil, drain and let cool, and then press them into the cheese filling. Roll the tortillas up and slice them into sandwich-sized burritos for a great lunch, late snack, or best of all, a borwn-bag or lunch box lunch. If you use a nice watercress, minced very fine or chopped, you can have hasperat for low tea. I must try this for Captain Janeway.
