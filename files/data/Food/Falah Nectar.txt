FOOD: Falah Nectar

A drink made from a meat by-product, considered a delicacy among the Nar Shaddan in the Delta Quadrant. Harry Kim of the U.S.S. Voyager tried Falah Nectar during a trading mission with the Nar Shaddan--because to refuse it would have insulted them--but as a result he got queasy for days. It made him feel like alien parasites were doing backflips in his stomach.
