PERSONNEL: Tolaris

One of the V'tosh ka'tur ("Vulcans without logic") encountered by Enterprise in 2151. Tolaris forged an unlikely bond with T'Pol, and suggested she attempt to re-connect with her emotions. He used an ancient Vulcan technique known as a "mind meld" to help her achieve this, but T'Pol was uncomfortable with it and asked him to stop. She eventually had to force him to break the meld. Captain Archer was angered by Tolaris' attack on T'Pol, and asked him to leave Enterprise.
