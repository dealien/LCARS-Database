PERSONNEL: Robin Lefler
Ensign, operations officer, U.S.S. Excalibur

Starfleet engineer serving aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise NCC-1701-D in 2368, and the compiler of Lefler's Laws. Both her parents served in Starfleet. Lefler had a brief romance with Wesley Crusher, and was instrumental with Crusher in preventing the Enterprise crew from falling prey to an addictive computer game. 
She was transferred to the U.S.S. Excalibur when that ship was assigned to offer a Federation presence in the former Thallonian Empire. While serving in that space she became reacquainted with her previously missing mother, Morgan, who was now discovered to be immortal- which explained her disappearance; she moved on before her family would learn of her immortality. Federation science never found Robin to have inherited that trait.
