PERSONNEL: Cabot
Ensign, stellar cartography, U.S.S. Enterprise-D

Crewmember on the Enterprise-D who asked to transfer from his post in Quantum Mechanics to the Stellar Cartography department in 2369. The head of Stellar Cartography, Commander Nella Daren, offered Ensign Cabot the transfer before clearing it with Executive Officer Riker, which was a breach of operational protocol that put Riker in an awkward position considering her relationship at the time with Captain Picard. According to Riker, Quantum Mechanics didn't want to give Cabot up, but Daren claimed that the department was overstaffed anyway and Cabot was perfect for the job she was offering.
