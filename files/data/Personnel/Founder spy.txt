PERSONNEL: Founder spy

This shapeshifter infiltrated Starfleet Command and impersonated Ambassador Krajensky in an effort to begin a conflict between the United Federation of Planets and the Tzenkethi in 2371. It is believed that the Founder killed the Terran citizen while the man vacationed on Risa- or at least was en route to that resort. The impersonator then informed Starfleet with flase information implicating the neighbor and encouraged them to send a starship to investigate. The Founder then headed the mission and recruited the assistance of the U.S.S. Defiant from Deep Space Nine. En route the Founder sabotaged the navigation system, locking in on course and sabotaged the cloaking system, disabling it and making the warship visible and vulnerable. The border breech was expected to start war.
The crew of the Defiant attempted to capture the Founder but suspicion and deceit amongst the crew hindered their own efforts. The Founder impersonated Chief Odo, Doctor Julian Bashir, and other crewmen to continue to confuse the crew and disrupt the teamwork efforts of a traditional crew. Odo personally took charge to hunt down and stop the Founder from causing any more trouble. During the exchange the Founder was mortally wounded. This action led to future problems for Odo since he was now the first Founder to ever kill another of their kind.
