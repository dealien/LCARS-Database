PERSONNEL: Pardek
Senator, Krocton Segment representative, Romulus 

Romulan politician who served 90 years in the senate and was one of the delegates sent to Khitomer in 2293 when the Klingons and Federation discussed the elimination of their Neutral Zone. At that Conference he began a dialog with then Captain Spock. Pardek seemed to support Romulan/Vulcan reunification and recruited Spock in 2368. Pardek turned over Spock, Captain Jean-Luc Picard, and Lieutenant Commander Data over to Proconsul Neral and other authorities when they infiltrated Romulus- in an effort to earn favor by the political leader. He was seen as a "man of the people" and a radical, having sponsored many governmental reforms and pursued the cause of peace with the Empire.
