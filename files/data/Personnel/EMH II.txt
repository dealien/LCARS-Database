PERSONNEL: Long Term Medical Hologram

A sentient holographic personality created to replace the original Emergency Medical Hologram program with a version designed for long term usage. The EMH was expected to operate during crisis situations to augment the traditional medical staff, then be deactivated. As the crew of the U.S.S. Voyager discovered, the program is capable of more, but the extra usage and attempts to add to the programming causes critical problems with extended use.
The EMH II was designed to compensate for these short comings and allow the LTMH to replace traditional medical staff in situations where space and resources are at a premium like small crew assignments and relay stations/ listening posts.
An EMH II was installed into the medical center of the prototype starship U.S.S. Prometheus. The EMH program assigned to the U.S.S. Voyager encountered the newer model when "The Doctor" was transferred to the newer starship in an effort to give a status update to Starfleet Command and to collect new orders to take back to the lonely vessel.
