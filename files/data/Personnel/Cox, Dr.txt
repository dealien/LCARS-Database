PERSONNEL: Cox
Psychiatrist

Starfleet psychiatrist who treated Gul Dukat while he was being held by Federation authorities after being captured on Deep Space 9. Dukat had suffered a mental breakdown after his daughter Ziyal was killed, and he failed to evacuate with other Dominion and Cardassian forces when the Federation recaptured control of the station. Until the war prisoner could be transported for arraignment, Dr. Cox counseled Dukat and encouraged him to talk about Ziyal whenever possible. After several weeks of treatment, he and other doctors declared that Dukat had made a remarkable recovery. Cox allowed Ben Sisko to visit Dukat and offer his condolences over Ziyal while aboard the U.S.S. Honshu en route to Starbase 621 for the hearing.
