PERSONNEL: Faith Garland
Nurse, Wright Field, New Mexico, Earth

A nurse with the Woman's Army Corps on Earth in the 20th century. Stationed at Wright Field, Garland was part of a team that investigated an extraterrestrial spacecraft of Ferengi origin that crashed on Earth near Roswell, New Mexico, in July 1947. Garland was something of a dreamer who foresaw a time when humanity would reach to the stars, forming a vast federation of planets. The Ferengi considered her pretty smart for a primitive female. After the visitors were being mistreated, she helped them return to their shuttle and escape back to their own time. Garland was engaged to Professor Jeff Carlson.
