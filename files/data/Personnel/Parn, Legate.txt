PERSONNEL: Parn
Legate, Central Command, Cardassia Prime

After Gul Dukat's capture in 2370, by the Maquis, Parn claimed Dukat armed Cardassian colonists and deserved his fate. Parn was actually covering his own complicity. Upon leaving he reminisced about being fond of his visits to the station before, but now found it quite cold.
