PERSONNEL: Richard Galen
Professor, archaeologist, Earth

Possibly the greatest archaeologist of the 24th century. Glen spent th last decade of his life attempting to confirm an extraordinary theory that numerous humanoid species in the galaxy had a common genetic heritage, born from the fact that some species apparently had "seeded" the primordial oceans of many worlds. Galen spent years gathering information from at least 19 planets across the quadrant in an effort to confirm his theory. Galen's greatest discovery was that the genetic codes on these planets could be assembled to form a computer program containing a message of peace from those ancient progenitors. Among Galen's students was Jean-Luc Picard, whom Galen hoped would also become an archaeologist. Although Picard instead chose to pursue a career in Starfleet, he was instrumental in completing Galen's last work.
