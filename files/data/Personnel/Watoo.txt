PERSONNEL: Watoo
Captain, merchant marines, Xeber

A Xebergerac citizen in command of a coastal cutter on the planet's oceans. While this planet does not have space flight capacity, it just acquired its warp capability at the section of time that Watoo came from. He was a new patron of the "Captain's Table" bar having been commissioned as a captain six months prior. He passed up several opportunities to enter the bar before he finally took the chance and went in. To his first impression the bar seemed like a place he would expect to find on Xeber. But after he had been there for a couple hours, and the clientele changed, he began to see the bar for what it really was, a place full of alien races. He sat at a table and was joined by Rake, d'Aleseo, an Andorian, and Julius Ramsey, a Starfleet ship commander.
