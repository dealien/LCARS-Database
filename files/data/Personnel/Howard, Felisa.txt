PERSONNEL: Felisa Howard

Homeopathic healer and Beverly Crusher's grandmother. Felisa became Beverly's primary caregiver after her mother's death in her youth. The two survived a great disaster at the Arvada III colony and Felisa taught Beverly how to use herbs and roots for medicine. She moved to the Caldos colony and continued her medicinal services there.
Felisa was the last Howard woman seduced by Ronin who paid her much attention; like filling her house with her favorite flower, camellias. Felisa kept very detailed journals of her experiences with Ronin, which were helpful to Beverly in identifying the nature of the alien.
