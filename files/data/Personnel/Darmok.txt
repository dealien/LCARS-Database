PERSONNEL: Darmok

In Tamarian mythology, Darmok was a hunter on planet Shantil III who fought a beast on the island of Tanagra with another hunter named Jalad. The Tamarians turned this story into part of their language, which is based entirely on metaphor. The phrase "Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra" describes an attempt by two people to understand each other by sharing a common experience.
