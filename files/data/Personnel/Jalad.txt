PERSONNEL: Jalad

Legendary figure from Tamarian mythology who stood with Darmok against a "beast" at the island of Tanagra. The Tamarians turned this story into part of their language, which is based entirely on metaphor. "Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra" describes an attempt by two people to understand each other by sharing a common experience. When Captain Picard of the U.S.S. Enterprise-D was attempting to communicate with a Tamarian counterpart, the Tamarian used the metaphor as an example, helping Picard decipher their cryptic language.
