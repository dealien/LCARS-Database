PERSONNEL: Matthew Ryan

First officer of the Earth cargo ship Fortunate. Ryan was a space boomer (like Travis Mayweather), and disapproved of Mayweather's decision to join Starfleet. He was also bent on revenge for an attack by Nausicaans, and held a Nausicaan captive until Mayweather confronted him for putting cargo ship crews at risk. Because of this incident, Captain Keene later stripped Ryan of his rank.
