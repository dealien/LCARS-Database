PERSONNEL: Anne Clancy
Engineering technician, U.S.S. Enterprise-D

She was put in charge of Engineering when La Forge and Data took a holodeck break. Clancy has also served as flight controller on the Bridge, such as during the encounter with the Klingon sleeper ship T'Ong. 

Reference: Elementary, Dear Data, The Emissary
Played by Anne Elizabeth Ramsay. The character's first name is conjectural based on the actor's real name. While the episode does not state a rank Picard has a standing policy against non-commissioned officers serving on the bridge so we have to beleive that she is an officer of some grade.
