Lieutenant, chief tactical officer, I.K.C. Br'Muk

A Klingon warrior serving on board the K'vort-class bird of prey, I.K.C. Br'Muk during its service in the Klingon Civil War, the Cardassian invasion, the tensions with the Federation in 2374, and the Dominion War. He was also witness to the events between Dargo, a junior officer under his command, and L'Grot, the former executive officer of the starship. He agreed with the report filed by Dargo and stated that the junior officer's findings and analysis were correct, despite L'Grot's claims to the contrary. Dargo sought his assistance in preparing for his trials before the High Council after Federation Ambassador Worf expelled him from Earth and from the Starfleet Academy.
