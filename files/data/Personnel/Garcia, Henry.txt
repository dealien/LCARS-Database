PERSONNEL: Henry Garcia

An unemployed person living in San Francisco's Sanctuary District A from 2022 to 2024. He had come to San Francisco to work in a brewery, but got laid off along with a bunch of other employees when new equipment was installed, and ended up in the Sanctuary. He had never been in trouble with the law, and only wanted a chance to work and live like regular people. Garcia was one of several Sanctuary residents who spoke on the Net (courtesy of Chris Brynner) to make the world aware of the plight of the homeless and disenfranchised. This took place in the midst of the uprising that later became known as the Bell Riots, which ultimately led to sweeping social reforms in the 21st-century United States.
