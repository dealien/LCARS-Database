Admiral, biological research director, Starfleet Research

This admiral traveled to Bajor to hold a conference of botanists and biologists to discuss possible sources of ketra-cell white. Ever since the Federation had learned that certain types of algae could be converted into the Jem'Hadar narcotic they have been searching for sources of the material so that they could get there first and prevent the Dominion from acquiring the raw materials. At the conference she confided information with Keiko O'Brien about her predictions of the war.
