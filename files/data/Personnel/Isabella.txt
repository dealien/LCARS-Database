PERSONNEL: Isabella

Name given by Clara Suter to her imaginary friend in 2368. Suter, a child aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise-D, was thought to be creating mischief and blaming it on her "imaginary friend" Isabella. 
It turned out that an unusual, non-corporeal entity from the FGC-47 Nebula had entered the ship and had assumed the identity of Suter's heretofore non-existant playmate. 

Imaginary Friend 
Played by Shay Astar.
