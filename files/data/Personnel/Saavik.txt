PERSONNEL: Saavik
Lieutenant, graduate student/cadet, Starfleet Academy

Female Vulcan and protégée of Spock, Saavik was enrolled at Starfleet Academy in 2285. She was studying command courses and did not think she performed well during the Kobayashi Maru simulation.
Saavik was later assigned to the science team aboard the U.S.S. Grissom to study the newly formed Genesis Planet with Dr. David Marcus. She was the first to discover humanoid lifesigns on the planet, and to discover a young Vulcan make that she deduced to be the reincarnated Spock. After being taken prisoner by the Klingon commander, Kruge, she was rescued by James Kirk in a rescue attempt.
She attended the fal-tor-pan ceremony on Mt. Seleya, Vulcan, and assisted with the repair operations of the commandeered Klingon bird-of-prey, dubbed the H.M.S. Bounty. She chose to remain on Vulcan, instead of returning to Earth with James Kirk and associates, to continue her studies.

This character was originally dessigned to be reprised again in "The Undiscovered Country," but it was changed to Valeris. Saavik was originally conceived to be half Vulcan, half Romulan, but that idea was dropped too. And, during Spock's pon farr on the Genesis Planet, Saavik was said to have mated with him, and that was one of her motivations to remain on Vulcan after her return, to raise the child she became pregnant with.
Played by Kirstie Alley during "The Wrath of Khan," Robin Curtis and during "The Search For Spock," and "The Voyage Home." Her return to study is conjectural to explain why she remained on Vulcan.
