PERSONNEL: Tom Harold
Lieutenant, Cestus III

A survivor of the Gorn attack on Cestus III, Harold was found by Kirk and the landing party in the war zone that was once a starbase on the planet. 
Suffering from severe radiation burns, Harold told Kirk of the events leading up to the attack, specifically how the Gorn ship approached at space-normal speed and surprised the starbase with their attack. Harold also surprised Kirk with the information that neither himself nor the starbase were able to send the message that lured Enterprise to Cestus III -- for the attack occurred a full day before the so-called message was (or could have been) sent.
