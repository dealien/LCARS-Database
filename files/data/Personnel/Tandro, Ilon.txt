PERSONNEL: Ilon Tandro
diplomatic officer, Klaestron IV

Head of the special diplomatic envoy from planet Klaestron IV who attempted to extradite Jadzia Dax from Deep Space 9 in 2369 for the murder of his father, General Ardelon Tandro. The general, who had been good friends with Curzon Dax, had been murdered 30 years before, but new evidence surfaced in 2369 implicating the Trill host. Tandro maintained that although Curzon Dax eas gone, Jadzia Dax could be procescuted for the murder of his father. The paramount question as to whether a Trill host was responsible for the symbiont's past lives was not addressed because the murder charge was laid to rest when Ardelon's widow, Enina Tandro, revealed that Curzon Dax was in bed with her at the time of the secret transmission that had been the source of the indictment.
