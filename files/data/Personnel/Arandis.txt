PERSONNEL: Arandis
Resort manager, Risa

Chief facilitator of the Temtibi Lagoon on the planet Risa in 2373. Curzon Dax had been a good friend of Arandis, and the two spent a lot of time together on his last trip to Risa in 2367. Curzon died while making love with Arandis. She termed it "death by jamaharon."

Reference: Let He Who Is Without Sin...
Played by Vanessa Williams.
We saw Curzon die in a flashback in Emissary, although Arandis was nowhere to be seen in that shot. We speculate that he suffered a serious heart attack in her presence, then died shortly after in a hospital room.
