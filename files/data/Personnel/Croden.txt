PERSONNEL: Croden

Fugutive from the planet Rakhar in the Gamma Quadrant. He was picked up in a damaged shuttlecraft and bought to Deep Space 9 in 2369. In a botched robbery attempt Croden killed the Miradorn Ro-Kel, which caused his twin brother, Ah-Kel, to vow revenge. While in Odo's jail, Croden told the shape-shifter he'd met others of his kind and offered as proof a unique necklace whose contents changed form. While Odo was returning Crodin to his homeworld, Odo learned that Croden's crime was having spoken out against his government. For punishment, most of his family was killed. Croden fled from the government, but was able to save only one member of his family, his daughter, Yareth, whom he hid on an asteroid in the Chamra Vortex. Odo returned Croden to the asteroid, where the necklace served as a key to unlock a stasis chamber in which Yarneth was hidden. Odo then allowed Croden and his daughter to leave on a Vulcan transport ship to start a new life.
