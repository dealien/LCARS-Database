PERSONNEL: Gerald Thompson
Lieutenant, counselor, U.S.S. Sutherland

A psychiatric officer assiged to the U.S.S. Sutherland to work with cadets and regular crew during training voyages. As the only regular officer in that department, he also served as the department head to the medical board, co-chaired by Dr. Ursula LaMoore, and Malachi, R.N.. 
Gerald was previously assigned to the U.S.S. Bersalis while it served along the Cardassian border during the Dominion War. After that ship suffered crippling damage to its computer systems the crew was evacuated and returned to Earth for reassignment. Gerald took the opportunity to take leave with his family and delayed being reassigned. During a Christmas gathering with his family he was introduced to some friends of his cousin-in-law, Joseph Burleigh. The friends were junior officers aboard the Sutherland and convinced him to apply for a posting on board that craft.
