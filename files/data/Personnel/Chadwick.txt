PERSONNEL: Michael Chadwick
Supervisor, Starfleet Intelligence

Operative in Starfleet Intelligence. In 2374 Chadwick supervised Miles O'Brien in an undercover operation on planet Farius Prime to flush out the name of the Orion Syndicate's informant in Starfleet. O'Brien was successful in doing that, but Chadwick extended the mission when he learned that the Syndicate had developed a relationship with the Dominion. Ultimately O'Brien and Chadwick prevented the Dominion-backed assassination of a Klingon ambassador, but at the sacrifice of Bilby, the Syndicate operative whom O'Brien had grown very close to. When O'Brien realized Chadwick had every intention of letting Bilby be killed, he punched Chadwick in the face and went to try and warn Bilby, but his fate was already sealed.
