a.k.a. K.C. Hunter, scifi writer, Harlem, Earth

Staff writer on the science fiction magazine, Incredible Tales, based in New York City. Kay Eaton used a gender-blurring pen name, K.C. Hunter, because 1953 readers were not ready for women science fiction writers. She and he husband Julius Eaton worked with Benny Russell. 
All of this was imagined by Captain Benjamin Sisko during an induced dream-vision.
