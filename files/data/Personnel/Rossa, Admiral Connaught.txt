PERSONNEL: Connaught Rossa
Admiral, Starfleet Headquarters

Starfleet officer who had two sons, also Starfleet officers, who were both killed in action. Admiral Rossa was under the impression for many years that her grandson, Jeremiah Rossa, was killed by Talerians at Galen IV in 2356. He was later discovered alive in 2367 with a Talarian family and the assumed name of Jono. He was discovered by U.S.S. Enterprise staff after the starship found a damaged Talarian Observation Craft. He had been adopted by Endar under their rituals. Rossa demanded that her grandson be returned to her on Earth. Captain Jean-Luc Picard reviewed the situation and felt that he spent his formidable years living with the Talarians and was culturally part of that race and should remain with his new family.
