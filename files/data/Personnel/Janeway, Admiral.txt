Admiral, starship commander

Father of Captain Kathryn Janeway, himself a Starfleet officer. He drowned under the polar ice of Tau Ceti Prime in 2358, leaving his daughter grief-stricken for months. In 2373, an alien intelligence assumed Admiral Janeway's form to aid Kathryn in accepting her imminent death. She managed to resist the temptation to join 'him,' and survived.
