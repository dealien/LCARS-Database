PERSONNEL: Ezral

This Kantare man was the chief engineer of a transport vessel that crash-landed circa 2130. Ezral believed himself to be responsible for the death of most of the crew, so he created holographic versions of the crewmembers, to serve as companions for his daughter, Liana. When Ezral's ruse was discovered by Archer, Ezral agreed to return to his home planet with his daughter.
