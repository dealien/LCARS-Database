PERSONNEL: Rene' Picard

Young nephew to Captain Jean-Luc Picard, the son of his brother Robert and wife Marie. Upon meeting René in 2367, Jean-Luc discovered that his nephew idolized his lifestyle and fancied himself as a starship commander too. Sadly, René was killed in 2371, along with his father Robert, in a tragic fire. Jean-Luc referred to him as a dreamer, imaginative, and very gentle. Rene's death put stress on the starship commander since he always took solice in knowing that there was a generation to succeed him, and was proud of the distant fact that he was an uncle.
