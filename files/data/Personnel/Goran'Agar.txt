PERSONNEL: Goran`Agar
First, Bopak III

A genetically mutated Jem'Hadar soldier that discovered he was not addicted to ketracel-white when he was marooned on Bopak III. He returned to the planet with a group of his men in hopes of finding a cure for them too; since he was convinced that an element of the planet brought about his mutation. Apparently, he is the only Jem'Hadar soldier able to survive without the drug as he learned. In 2372 he captured the U.S.S. Rubicon with Dr. Julian Bashir and Chief Miles O'Brien aboard. He compelled Dr. Bashir to seek a cure for the addiction, and Bashir became obsessed with the quest, with fatal consequences. When he was not successful in finding a cure, Goran'Agar released the two starfleet officers and sought to deal with his men himself.
