PERSONNEL: Spectre

Denizen of the Kohl hibernation system's virtual reality. The ghastly, looming Spectre was death incarnate to the subconscious of those hibernators within the Kohl virtual reality. Spectre and Clown were separate, yet menacing, aspects of the system. However, even Spectre operated at the Clown's bidding.
