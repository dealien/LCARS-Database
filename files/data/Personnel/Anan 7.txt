PERSONNEL: Anan 7
Planetary leader, Eminiar VII

Leader of the High Council of the planet Eminiar VII in 2267. Anan 7 was his planet's military commander in the war between Eminiar and Vendikar. When the U.S.S. Enterprise arrived at Eminiar Vii in 2267, Ana tried to warn the ship to stay away. After the Enterprise ignored the warning, it was Anan's difficult task to enforce the declaration that the ship was a war casualty under the agreement between his government and Vendikar. When Captain James Kirk refused to surrender his ship, Anan agreed to peace talks with the Vendikar government to avoid the possibility of real war.
