PERSONNEL: Gorn Captain

After Gorn forces destroyed the Earth outpost on Cestus III claiming it was an intrusion into their space, the captain of the Gorn vessel and Captain Kirk were transported by the Metrons to a planet where each fought for the survival of his respective crew. Kirk won, but refused to kill the Gorn after realizing that the Gorn attack had been the result of a misunderstanding.
