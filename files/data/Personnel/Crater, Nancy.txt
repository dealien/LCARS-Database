Wife of archaeologist Robert Crater who accompanied her husband to planet M-113 in 2261 and was killed about three years later by the last surviving salt-sucking creature native to that planet. The creature used its hypnotic powers to appear to Prof. Crater as Nancy, giving him companionship in return for a steady supply of salt. In 2266 the creature also appeared in her form to Leonard McCoy, who had been romantically involved with Nancy about ten years prior.
