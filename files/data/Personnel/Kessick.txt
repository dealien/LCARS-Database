PERSONNEL: Kessick

Xindi-Humanoid who worked in a trellium-D mining facility in the Delphic Expanse. Kessick gave Captain Archer further information about his people in exchange for Archer helping him to escape the mines. Kessick was fatally wounded during the escape attempt. He did, however, manage to pass along the coordinates for the Xindi homeworld with his dying breath.

Portrayed by Richared Lineback. I am not sure that his name is truly spelled Richared- it could be a spelling error on The Continuum.
