PERSONNEL: The Keeper
Leader of the mentally advanced Talosians who captured U.S.S. Enterprise Captain Christopher Pike and attempted to convince him to live a life in captivity. Although failing at this task and being forced to let Pike escape, The Keeper did allow Pike to return after a disfiguring accident, allowing Pike to live the rest of his life under an illusion of youth and health. 

Reference: The Cage 
Played by Meg Wyllie. A woman was used for this role since it was thought that a female in make-up would look a bit more alien as a man, than a regular man in make-up.
