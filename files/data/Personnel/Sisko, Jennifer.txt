PERSONNEL: Jennifer Sisko
scientist, U.S.S. Saratoga

Federation scientist who married Benjamin Sisko and had one child, Jake, before being killed in 2367 by the Borg while aboard the U.S.S. Saratoga. She and Ben met on Gilgo Beach shortly after he graduated from the Academy. He was carrying lemonades to his friends and walking across the hot sands when the heat began to burn his feet. He took refuge on Jennifer's blanket spread and introduced himself while he waited for his feet to feel better enough to finish the trek to the location of his friends.
A mirror-universe Jennifer was separated from her husband and worked for the Cardassian-Klingon Alliance. She was assigned to work on a transpectral sensor array to locate Terran resistance in the Badlands. While she came from a priviledged Terran family she felt that her work to end the resistance would prevent further loss of human life. She traveled to our universe and persuaded Jake to return with her, where he was held as a hostage to convince Benjamin Sisko to assist the stronger resistance in their new plans to built its own Defiant in time to fend off an impending attack by Alliance forces. She was killed by the Kira Nerys mirror while saving Jake Sisko, the child she never had.
