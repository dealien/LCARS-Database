Crewman, engineering officer, S.S. Santa Maria

Former Engineer of the S.S. Santa Maria and a member of the colony on Orellius. He was taken against his will to Orellius after the Santa Maria was abotaged and forced to land there instead of its original destination. Despite his skills as an engineer he was unable to identify the cause of the failure that damaged his ship, or that prevented technology from operating on Orellius. Joseph helped with the attempted escape of Sisko and O'Brien. He then chose to remain on Orellius with the rest of the colonists.
