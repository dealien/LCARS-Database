Tom Paris' first serious girlfriend, who dumped him during his freshman year at Starfleet Academy. Paris was so depressed over the breakup he developed hives and couldn't get out of bed for a week. He nearly failed his Stellar Cartography class, and claims he walked around in a daze for the rest of the school year. Paris related this story to Voyager's Doctor in 2372 when the EMH asked him how to recover from romantic rejection.
