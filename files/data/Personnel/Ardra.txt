PERSONNEL: Ardra

A mythic figure in the theology of planet Ventax II.According to Ventaxian legend, Ardra appeared a thousand years ago and promised the Ventaxian people a millenium of peace and prosperity. At the end of that time Adra promised to return and enslave the population. Accoridng to the mythology Adra's return was to be heralded by "the shaking of the cities" and other paranormal phenomena. These prophecies apparently came to pass in 2367 when a humanoid female appeared on Ventax II, identifying herslef as Ardra. Investigation by crew from the U.S.S. Enterprise-D personnel determined, however, that this person was a con artist using various technological tricks to simulate Ventaxian propehcy.
