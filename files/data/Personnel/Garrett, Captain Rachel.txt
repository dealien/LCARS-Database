PERSONNEL: Rachel Garrett
Captain, starship commander, U.S.S. Enterprise-C

Captain of the U.S.S. Enterprise-C in the mid-24th century. Garrett and the Enterprise-C vanished in 2344 when a torpedo explosion near Narendra III opened up a temporal rift, and emerged in 2366. The disappearance created an alternate timeline in which the Klingon Empire was at war with the Federation. In this altered future, Captain Garrett was killed in a Klingon attack. Lt. Richard Castillo subsequently assumed command of the Enterprise-C, returning it to its proper time so that history could be substantially restored.
