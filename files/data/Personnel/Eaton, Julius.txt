PERSONNEL: Julius Eaton
Scifi writer, Harlem, Earth

Staff writer on the science fiction magazine, Incredible Tales, based in New York City. His wife, Kay Eaton used a gender-blurring pen name, K.C. Hunter, because 1953 readers were not ready for women science fiction writers. The Eatons worked with Benny Russell. This was all imaginary for Captain Sisko after he suffered a Prophet induced dream in which he tranpsoed his co-workers into these new roles. This person took on the characteristics of Dr. Bashir.

Played by Alexander Siddig, who also played Julian Bashir in all of Deep Space Nine.
