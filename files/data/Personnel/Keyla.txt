PERSONNEL: Keyla

Captain Archer met the mysterious Keyla on a Risan vacation in 2152 when Porthos encountered her dog Rhylo. Though Keyla seemed to be making romantic overtures toward Archer, she kept asking questions about his encounters with the Cabal. Later, she said that the Suliban murdered her entire family. A surreptitious bio-scan revealed that she was Tandaran, leading Archer to believe that she was possibly connected to Colonel Grat. When Archer confronted Keyla, she rendered him unconscious and left before he could ask her any more questions.
