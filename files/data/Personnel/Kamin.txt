PERSONNEL: Kamin
A talented ironweaver, loving husband, father and grandfather who lived on Kataan during Earth's 14th Century. While controlled by the Kataan probe in 2368, Picard lived Kamin's entire life in 25 minutes. 
He was considered to be the best ironweaver in Ressik, their home town, but he preferred to play with his flure made of tin. He was married to Eline when the memories began, and fathered two children; a daughter Meribor, and a son Batai. Kamin spent the early part of his life trying to gain an understanding of his place in his new community. He also spent a great deal of time building telescopes and other astronomy tools. After accepting his position on Kataan he settled down and began a family.
His friend Batai, was leader of the town council and listened well to Kamin's theories about the weather. From Kamin's scientific experiments he learned that the planet was not suffering from a simple drought, and drastic measures were needed to guarantee the population. One of his ideas involved the creation of moisture reclaimators that would condense the humidity in the air.
After the death of his friend, he took his place on the town's leader seat and continued to work to find a resolution to the drying conditions that threatened the population. He later learned that a team of scientists were going to launch a probe that would carry the memories of the population into space and would make contact with an alien in the future; which turned out to be his real identity of Captain Jean-Luc Picard.
