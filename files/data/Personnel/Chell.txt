PERSONNEL: Chelll
Maquis, tactical and engineering officer, U.S.S. Voyager

A Bolian male, Chell was a Maquis resistance fighter who, in 2371, served aboard Chakotay's ship, which was swept into the Delta Quadrant. Chell, like the other Maquis on that ship, joined the crew of the U.S.S. Voyager on their journey home. Chell was prone to impudence and other disruptive behavior, and therefore was assigned, along with other Maquis crewmembers, to special field training by Lt. Tuvok. He eventually became a disciplined and reliable crewman, but he never completely felt comfortable among his Starfleet peers. His latent distrust and paranoia re-surfaced in 2377, when ex-Maquis crewmembers on Voyager were being mysteriously attacked. 
He transferred departments and was assigned to the Elite Forces unit for tactical security.
