PERSONNEL: Day
Colonel, Bajor

Bajoran military officer who was secretly a member of the Alliance for Global Unity or "The Circle." Day participated in the takeover of station Deep Space 9 in 2370. He was under the titular command of General Krim, but actually followed orders from Minister Jaro. Day tried to prevent Starfleet personnel from informing Krim that the Circle was receiving covert Cardassian support. When Krim did learn of the Circle's Cardassian backing, Day resisted Krim's order to return the station to Starfleet control. In the ensuing fray, Day tried to kill Commander Benjamin Sisko, but instead killed Bajoran resistance hero Li Nalas.
