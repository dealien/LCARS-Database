PERSONNEL: Daro
Glinn, executive officer

Aide to Gul Macet, one of two Cardassian glinns who came aboard the Enterprise-D in 2367 as an observer during the search for the renegade starship Phoenix. While aboard, Daro made friendly overtures to Chief Miles O'Brien, but O'Brien found it difficult to be cordial to an ex-enemy. But over drinks in Ten-Forward, O'Brien approached Daro and explained himself, relating his experiences during the massacre at Setlik III. He confessed to Daro that he didn't hate Cardassians, but he hated what he had become because of them.
