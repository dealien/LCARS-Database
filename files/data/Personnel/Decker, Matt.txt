PERSONNEL: Matt Decker
Commodore, starship commander, U.S.S. Constellation

Commander of the U.S.S. Constellation. When his ship was attacked by a stray extragalactic "planet killer" weapon in 2267, Commodore Decker evacuated his crew to the third planet in the L-374 system while he stayed aboard. But then they died when the planet killer destroyed the entire system. Gripped by grief and guilt, Decker later commandeered a shuttlecraft from the U.S.S. Enterprise on a suicide mission to destroy the machine. He died during the unsuccessful attempt, but his actions paved the way for the Enterprise to complete the planet killer's demise.
