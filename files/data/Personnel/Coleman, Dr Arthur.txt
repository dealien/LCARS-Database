PERSONNEL: Arthur Coleman
Doctor, chief medical officer, Camus II

Physician who was one of two survivors of a disastrous archeological expedition to planet Camus II in 2269. After the death of his colleagues, Coleman conspired with Dr. Janice Lester, the other survivor, to use a life-energy transfer device to place Lester's mind into the body of Captain Kirk, and to trap Kirk's mind in Lester's body. Coleman participated in the scheme because he was in love with Lester, and when it was determined that she was insane, he asked to be allowed to care for her.
