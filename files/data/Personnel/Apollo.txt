PERSONNEL: Apollo

Humanoid entity once worshiped as a God by the ancient Greeks on planet Earth. To the ancient Greeks, Apollo was the God of light and purity, skilled in the bow and on the lyre. He was the twin brother of Artemis, son of the God Zeus and Latona, a mortal. The extraterrestrial Apollo and his fellow "Gods" had an extra organ in their chests that apparently gave them the ability to channel considerable energy, giving them godlike powers. After leaving Earth, Apollo settled on planet Pollux IV, where he grew to miss the adulation he had received from the Greeks. In 2267 he attempted to capture the crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise, inviting them to live on the planet and worship him as a God. When it became clear that the Enterprise crew could not comply he spread himslef against the wind and disappeared.
