PERSONNEL: Philip Boyce
Doctor, chief medical officer, U.S.S. Enterprise

Original medical officer aboard the Federation starship under the commands of Captain Robert April and Christopher Pike. In 2254, Boyce noted that Pike was suffering from exhaustion following a mission to Rigel VII and urged him to relax a bit to avoid burnout. Boyce was often seen prescribing medicine and alcohol (not at the same time) to patients since he was of the opinion that there are things a man will tell his bartender that he would never tell his doctor.
