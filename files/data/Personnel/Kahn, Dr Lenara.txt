PERSONNEL: Lenara Kahn
Scientist, project leader, Trill Ministry of Science

Trill host and leader of a scientific research team at Deep Space 9 in 2372. She, her brother Bejal Otner, and her team, with the assistance of the U.S.S. Defiant and the crew from DS9, were successful in opening a stable wormhole for 23.4 seconds. 
A year later Lenara devised a plan to permanently close the Bajoran wormhole without harming it or the Prophets that created it. The plan was considered as an emergency procedure to prevent the Dominion from taking over the Quadrant.
Lenara and Jadzia Dax shared memories of a previous marriage between their symbionts, as Nilani Kahn and Torias Dax. They were tempted to reignite the passion, despite Trill taboos against reassosciation. Jadzia felt strong enough to reestablish the relationship, but Lenara did not want to face exile, the expected punishment for their actions.
