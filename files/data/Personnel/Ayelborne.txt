PERSONNEL: Ayelborne
Planetary leader, Organia

Leader of the Council of Elders on planet Organia. Ayelborne, along with all the Organians, welcomed representatives of both the Federation and the Klingon Empire to his planet in 2267. Ayelborne ignored strong warnings from Federation representative James Kirk that Klingon occupation would have potentially disasterous consequences to the technologically unsophisticated Organian people. It was later learned that the Organians were an incredibly advanced civilization of non-corporeal life-forms who had been masquerading in humanoid form in order to make it easier for the Klingon and Federation representatives to deal with them. Ayelborne predicted that the Federation and Klingon antagonists would become fast friends.
