PERSONNEL: Morath

Kahless the Unforgettable's brother. Morath embodied dishonorable Klingon behavior and told lies which upset his brother. Kahless and Morath's legendary twelve day and night combat represents the difficult struggle honor requires of all Klingons. A small statue of the battle adorned Worf's table in his quarters.
