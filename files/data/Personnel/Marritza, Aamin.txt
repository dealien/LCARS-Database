PERSONNEL: Aamin Marritza
file clerk, Gallitep, Bajor

Cardassian file clerk in Gul Darhe'el's nightmarish Gallitep labor camp. In 2369 Marritza's guilt led him to impersonate Darhe'el, hoping to be punished for occupation atrocities he did not oppose. 

Reference: Duet 
Played by Harris Yulin, who, for obvious reasons, also played Gul Darhe'el.
