PERSONNEL: Maxwell Forrest
Vice Admiral, operations officer, Starfleet Command

Starfleet Admiral who maintains regular contact with Captain Archer, monitoring the Enterprise NX-01's first mission. Forrest ordered the Enterprise to return Klaang to Kronos, despite the misgivings of the Vulcans. He regularly confered with Vulcan Ambassador Soval, and they often clash regarding Archer and Enterprise. While on a mission to Vulcan he sacrificed his life to save Soval when the Earth Embassy was attacked.
Previously he was in charge of prototype and testing within Starfleet and was responsible for the selection of pilots for operation of the test vessels. Archer and others were test pilots serving under Forrest at that time.
In the Mirror Universe he served as captain of the Terran Empire's I.S.S. Enterprise NX-01. Forrest clashed with the Mirror Universe's Jonathan Archer over who should command the ship. Ultimately, Archer's mutiny put Forrest in the brig, only to be freed by the Mirror T'Pol. During Enterprise's attempt to steal the future starship U.S.S. Defiant from Tholian hands, I.S.S. Enterprise was destroyed, with Forrest on the bridge.
