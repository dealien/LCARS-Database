PERSONNEL: Gorkon
Chancellor, planetary leader, Qo'noS

Gorkon was leader of the Klingon High Council in the late 23rd century, during a crisis which pushed the Klingon Empire to seek peace with the United Federation of Planets. Gorkon established communications with Ambassador Spock, who arranged for a conference to discuss the terms of the treaty. Gorkon was assassinated by dissidents who wished to stop the peace initiative. In an unprecedented move, Gorkon's daughter, Azetbur, continued the peace talks in her father's place.
