PERSONNEL: Morag
Commander, starship commander, 

Klingon commander who buzzed (flew very close) Relay Station 47 while patrolling the Federation Border. He did it often and with the intention of annoying/ harrassing the crew. Once he even locked disruptors on the station.  He was accused of murdering Lieutenants Aquiel Uhnari and Keith Rocha in 2369, but Morag was guilty only of pilfering data.
