PERSONNEL: Arridor
PhD, diplomatic officer, Ferenginar

Member of a Ferengi delegation sent to negotiate for the rights to the Barzan wormhole in 2366. Dr. Arridor was responsible for the distillation of a Ferengi pyrocyte which DaiMon Goss used to poison the Federation ambassador, Dr. Mendoza. Dr. Arridor was one of the crew of the Ferengi shuttle sent to investigate the Barzan wormhole; he was lost in the distant Delta Quadrant when the wormhole changed location. Arridor and Kol crash landed on the takarian homeworld and assumed the role of the Great Sages from Takarian mythology. In 2373, the U.S.S. Voyager happened upon the planet and forced Arrifor and Kol to leave. When they attempted to return to the takarian planet, their shuttle was pulled into the Barzan wormhole by a gravitational eddy. Their actions knocked the wormhole off its subspace axis so that both ends of its endpoints jumped around erradically. The fate of Arridor and the shuttle remain unknown.
