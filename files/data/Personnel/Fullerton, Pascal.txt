PERSONNEL: Pascal Fullerton
Chairman, lobbyist, New Essentialist Movement

A reactionary organization dedicated to "restoring the moral traditions" of the Federation . In 2373, Fullerton and several members of the New Essentialists Movement journeyed to Risa to hold rallies, protesting the vacation planet as an example of what he saw as serious decay in the moral fiber of the Federation. Fullerton subsequently sabotaged the planet's weather control system in order to make their point that Federation citizens were becoming too complacent.
