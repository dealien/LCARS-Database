PERSONNEL: Azetbur
Chancellor, Qo'noS

Daughter of Klingon Chacelor Gorkon, Azetbur ascended to lead the Klingon High Council after the assassination of her father in 2293. As chancellor, Azetbur continued Gorkon's peace initiative with the Federation, concluding with the historic Khitomer peace accords. She is the only female to serve on the Council, or as Chancellor of the Klingon Empire.

Played by Rosana DeSoto. The Continuum spelled her name Aztbur. The episode "Redemption" established that under Klingon law a woman could not head the Council, which must have been passed after Azetbur served in that position.
