PERSONNEL: Ruth Bonaventure

One of the three women that Harry Mudd was transporting in 2266 to serve as potential wives for settlers on Ophiucus III. Unforeseen circumstances, however, meant that Ruth and the two other women ended up on planet Rigel XII and married miners. She had long black hair and previously lived on a pelagic planet with sea rachers before being recruited by Mudd.

Reference: Mudd's Women 
Played by Maggie Thrett. Ruth's last name was never mentioned in the aired version, but a final draft of the episode listed her as Ruth Bonaventure.
