PERSONNEL: Stephen Garrovick
Ensign, security officer, U.S.S. Enterprise

Son of Captain Garrovick. Ensign Garrovick served as a security officer aboard the Starship Enterprise, and in 2268, he encountered the same deadly dikironium cloud creature that had killed his father 11 years prior. Like James T. Kirk in 2257, Ensign Garrovick paused briefly before firing at the creature, and believed his hesitation caused the death of several people. Later, the crew learned that phaser fire had no effect upon the creature, a fact which absolved both Ensign Garrovick and Captain Kirk of guilt.
