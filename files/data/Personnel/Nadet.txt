PERSONNEL: Nadet

When the Enterprise NX-01 encountered the Novans in 2152, Nadet was the oldest member of the colony. Nadet's human birth name was Bernadette Fuller - she was the daughter of Vera Fuller, one of the original colonists. Nadet had no memory of her human existence until Captain Archer showed her a picture of a young Bernadette with her mother. This evidence helped Nadet to remember her past, and she eventually convinced the Novans that they are descended from humans.
