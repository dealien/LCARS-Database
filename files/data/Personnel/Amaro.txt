Security officer, Deep Space Nine
 
Amaro was killed in action during a salvage mission to the derelict Empok Nor station in 2373. 

Reference: Empok Nor
Played by Jeffrey King. The character’s first name is conjectural based on the actor’s real name. This actor made one of the few derogatory comments in Star Trek; even more rare coming from a Starfleet officer. While Garak was hunting the Cardassian officers on the station he was supposed to hear background discussions from his DS9 colleagues, Amaro and Boq’ta. The discussion was not scripted since it was not supposed to be heard clearly, but the filming of the episode picked up the conversation. Amaro had a short bit talking about his recently killed partner, Stolzoff, and ended with the comment about wanting to kill the "spoonhead" who got her. During a final review the comment was noticed and approved for broadcast since the comment proved the character's state of mind at the time.
