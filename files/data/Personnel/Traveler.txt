PERSONNEL: "Traveler"

Mysterious humanoid from Tau Alpha C with the ability to focus space and time with his thoughts, apreviously unsuspected relationship. He, himself, was a student of human behavior and sought passage on Federation ships as a means of observing humans, psoing as an assistant to Starfleet propulsion specialist Kosinski. When the Traveler and Kosinski were aboard the Enterprise-D, a slight miscalculation caused the Traveler to send the ship first to Galaxy M33, then an even greater extra-galactic distance. During that time the Traveler befriended young Wesley Crusher and encourage Captain Jean-Luc Picard to support his unusual talents in mathematics, engineering, and science.
The Traveler returned to the Enterprise-D in 2367 when a static warp bubble experiment created by Wesley Crusher  accidentally escaped its confines and trapped his mother, Dr. Beverly Crusher into its alternate reality. The Traveler used his mental abilities to establish a stable gateway through which Beverly was able to return to the traditional reality before the bubble collapsed.
In 2370 the Traveler assumed the identify of Lakanta, a colonist on Dorvan V. In this guise he introduced Wesley to the concept of the vision quest, and helped Wes to see that he had a future beyond Starfleet nad beyond traditional humanity. The Traveler offered to be his guide in this new plane of existence.
