Female Cardassian scientist who was part of a joint Bajoran-Cardassian-Federation team working from Deep Space Nine in 2371 on a project aimed at permitting communication via the Bajoran wormhole between the Alpha and Gamma Quadrants. She was accompanied by a colleague Gilora Rejal. Their arrival apparently fulfilled an ancient Bajoran prophecy that seemed to predict the destruction of Deep Space Nine.
