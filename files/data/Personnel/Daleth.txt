PERSONNEL: Daleth

Ambassador of Vaskan race in the Delta Quadrant. Daleth engaged in trade negotiations with Captain Janeway of the U.S.S. Voyager in late 2374, just prior to the start of the Great War between the Vaskans and the Kyrians. For centuries history held that Daskan and a ruthless Janeway were responsible for triggering the Great War that nearly wiped out the Kyrian race, as depicted in the Museum of Kyrian Heritage. But in the 31st century a backup module of Voyager's EMH was found and activated, and the Doctor was able to set history straight as to who were the aggressors in that war.
