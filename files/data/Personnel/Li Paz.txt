PERSONNEL: Li Paz

A Maquis rebel who was friends with Chakotay and B'Elanna Torres. Li Paz was killed in 2373 when virtually the entire Maquis movement was slaughtered by the Cardassian/Dominion alliance. Chakotay and Torres, being stranded in the Delta Quadrant on the U.S.S. Voyager, did not learn of this massacre until they received a datastream transmission in 2374 with the news. The day after hearing of this, Torres created a holodeck program simulating the slaughter, including the murder of Li Paz. Torres realized from running this program that she had lost the capacity to feel, and began sinking into depression and engaging in acts of self-destruction.
