PERSONNEL: Samuel T. Cogley
Defense attorney, Starbase 11

Attorney who defended James T. Kirk at his 2267 court-martial on Starbase 11, where the captain was on trial for the murder of Ben Finney. Cogley won the case by proving that the Enterprise computer wrongly implicated Kirk, and it was later shown that the computer malfunction was engineered by a still-living Finney. Cogley went on to defend Ben Finney in his own trial for a variety of charges stemming from his failed scheme to frame Kirk. Cogley loved antique books and shunned the use of computers whenever possible.
