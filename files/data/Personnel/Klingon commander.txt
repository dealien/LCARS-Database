This heroic warrior led three battle cruisers into the energy cloud surrounding V'Ger as the entity tried to make its way back to Earth through a piece of Klingon space. After attempting to destroy V'Ger with their photon torpedoes, and failing, they were "decompiled" by V'Ger, thus ending his life. The encounter was monitored by the Epsilon 9 monitoring station within Federation space.
