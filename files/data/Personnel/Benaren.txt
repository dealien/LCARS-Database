PERSONNEL: Benaren

Ocampan man, husband to Martis and father of Kes. Benaren died in 2371, shortly after Kes' first birthday. Kes praised her father as a very wise man, who shaped her into the person she is. Kes also cited her father as the source for her strength to question her people's beliefs and leave her city (which eventually led to her joining the U.S.S. Voyager). Because Benaren was the greatest inspiration of her life, Kes suggested to Ensign Wildman that she name her unborn baby after him. Dreadnought, Resolutions,
