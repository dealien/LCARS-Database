PERSONNEL: Bok
DaiMon, starship commander

Ferengi officer set on revenge for the death of his son who was killed after an encounter with the U.S.S. Stargazer, commanded by Jean-Luc Picard, in 2355. Hi s revenge used a thought maker in an attempt to take control of the Starfleet captain. It was introduced to Picard when Bok offered to return the salvaged Stargazer as a gift to the victor of the Battle of Maxia. First officer Kazago took Bok into custody for participating in acts that served no profit.
After failing in his attempt to destroy Picard, Bok was stipped of his title and sent to Rog Prison. He later resurfaced in 2370, attempting to kill Picard's "son" Jason Vigo. The young man was not Picard's son, but his DNA had been resequenced to imply that he was. Bok was, once again, released to Ferengi authorities after this other attempt at revenge failed.
