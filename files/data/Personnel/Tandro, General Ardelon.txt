PERSONNEL: Ardelon Tandro
General, military leader, Klaestron IV

Statesman from the planet Klaestron IV who was reportedly murdered in 2339 during a civil war on his planet. He became a national hero after his death, with statues of him erected all over the planet. Ardelon Tandro was good freinds with Federation mediator Curzon Dax, but was unaware that his wife, Enina Tandro, was conducting a love affair with Dax. Thirty years later, when Jadzia Dax was accused of Tandro's murder, Dax refused to offer any defense, preferred to be found guilty rather than betray Enina. It was not until Enina came forward and admitted that she had been in bed with Curzon Dax at the time of a secret transmission that Dax was acquitted. Enina also spoke privately with Jadzia Dax, explaining that her late husband had betrayed his own people. The rebels had killed him for it, but that truth remained secret.
