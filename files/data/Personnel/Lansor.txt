PERSONNEL: Lansor

An individual assimilated by the Borg and given the designation Two of Nine, Primary Adjunct of Unimatrix 01. Prior to his assimilation, Lansor worked in mathematics; he calculated equations for another man. He was eating with a group of men when he was abducted. As a drone, Two of Nine was a member of the same unimatrix as Seven of Nine. In 2368 the vessel he occupied crashed on Planet 1865-Alpha, and only four of the drones survived. When he and two others began to regain their individuality, Seven of Nine created new interlink nodes in their brains to create a mini-collective among the three, to ensure they would not escape. After they were recovered by the Borg, they found they were a subset among the Collective, and were tormented by hearing three voices whispering in one ear and a crowd screaming in another. They worked together to escape the Borg and had their implants removed on Inavar Prime, but doctors there could not break the neural link among them. Desperate to gain their individuality, the three ex-drones tracked Seven of Nine to the U.S.S. Voyager, where the Doctor aboard determined that breaking the link would cause them to die after a few weeks. But the decision was made to break the link, and Lansor opted to stay aboard the Markonian space station in the time he had left, to meet new people and fill his life with life again.
