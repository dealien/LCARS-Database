PERSONNEL: Jeffrey

The holographic "son" of Voyager's EMH in a holodeck program that the Doctor designed to help him experience family life. Jeffrey and the two others, Charlene and Belle, were so "ridiculously perfect," that Torres could not handle being in their company. Torres offered to "tweak" the program so the Doctor's family life would be more reflective of reality. After the holo-daughter, Belle, suffered a mortal head injury and later died, the Doctor deactivated the program, and Jeffrey ceased to exist.
