PERSONNEL: Raymond Boone
crewman, U.S.S. Rutledge

He served during the Setlik III massacre of 2347. Taken captive by the Cardassians, Boone was later killed. The Cardassians then altered one of their agents to look like Boone in an elaborate plot to implicate Miles O'Brien in Maquis activity. That man took up residence on Volon III with Boone's real wife and family. The ruse was successful for many years even though his wife did not behavior changes that caused their marriage to end. The duplicate Boone was uncovered by Odo prior to the plot's success.
