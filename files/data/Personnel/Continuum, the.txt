PERSONNEL: The Continuum

The official Star Trek website operated by Paramount Pictures and CBS Studios, formerly of Viacom. This website endeavored to portray information about the TV series and to fill in the gaps amongst the numerous other official information sources. It features commercials, teasers, and press releases, as well as a data presentation section. 
Unfortunately many references in the data display area is wrong, and the website lacks the detail and information found on popular fan-based sites. Also unfortunate that as many websites were closed due to pressure from the copyright holder, the official site has not increased its accuracy and apparently is run by web-saavy persons that have NOT watched the show. In all cases where there are contradictions between the Continuum and the Encyclopedia, the book is correct. While not yet confirmed for all aspects, the Memory Alpha wikipedia is also a better and more creditable resource for information- containing FAR more data and images than the official site.
