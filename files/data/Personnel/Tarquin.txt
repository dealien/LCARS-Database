PERSONNEL: Tarquin

Telepathic alien male. As a telepath, Tarquin is rare among his people — the odds are one in fifty million. Telepaths are considered a threat to the greater population and sent to live in exile. Tarquin is the sole inhabitant of his planet, living in a massive sanctuary. His family gave him an object that extends the range of his telepathy, which he uses to seek out unique minds. When he finds such an individual, he tries to lure her to his homeworld and become his companion. His species has a very long lifespan, and he has already out-lived four companions. He planned on Hoshi Sato becoming his next companion, but she refused. Tarquin aided Enterprise by giving Hoshi the coordinates for a Xindi colony.
