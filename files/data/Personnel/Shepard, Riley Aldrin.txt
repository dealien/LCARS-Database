Starfleet Academy Red Squad cadet duped into supporting Admiral Leyton's illegal maneuvers in 2372. He and members of his team sabotaged Earth's global power grid at the Division of Planetary Operations headquarters in Lisbon, Portugual. Since he was following orders from the admiral he did not realize that it was treasonous and probably assumed it was an excersize to all involved. In 2374 Shepard was on the U.S.S. Valiant NCC-74210 when it was destroyed by Dominion forces.
