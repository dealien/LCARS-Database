PERSONNEL: Akuta
Leader, Gamma Trianguli VI

Leader of the native people of Gamma Trianguli VI, who was known as "the eyes of Vaal" because he wore antennae by which he received commands from their god, Vaal. When visited by an Enterprise landing party, Akuta was instructed to kill the visitors because Vaal considered them a threat. However, the Enterprise destroyed Vaal, which was actually a computer, and left Akuta and his people on their own to discover the everyday ways of life, including birth and death.
