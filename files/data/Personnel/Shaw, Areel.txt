PERSONNEL: Areel Shaw
Prosecutor, Judge Advocate General, Starbase 11

Prosecutor in the 2267 court-martial of U.S.S. Enterprise Captain James T. Kirk. A Starfleet attorney assigned to the Judge Advocate General's office, she was unsuccessful in the prosecution of Captain Kirk, due to the revelation that the death of crewman Ben Finney, which had led to Kirk's court-martial, was in fact a hoax perpetrated to end Kirk's Starfleet career. Shaw prosecuted the case despite the fact that she and Kirk had once been lovers four years earlier.
