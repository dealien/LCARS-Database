PERSONNEL: Hal Lynch
Sergeant, security officer, United States Air Force, Omaha Air Base

The on duty officer when Captain James Kirk and Lieutenant Hikaru Sulu were beamed inside the Omaha Air Base in an effort to destroy records that revealed the U.S.S. Enterprise's visit to 1969 air space over Earth. Sergeant Lynch discovered the two Starfleet officers and confiscated their machines. He was accidentally beamed aboard the starship and posed a problem to the timeline if he was returned in his current condition. He was detained in the transporter room under the supervision of Chief Kyle. Fortunately Commander Spock was able to predict the duplicate maneuvers to return the starship to its own time and the steps necessary to return the sergeant and another misplaced time-line officer to their proper place in time.
