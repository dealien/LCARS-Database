PERSONNEL: Stephen William Hawking
PhD, physicist, Earth

Considered one of the most brilliant theoretical physicists of 20th-century Earth. Hawking developed a quantum theory of gravity in which he sought to link the two major theories of physics: quantum mechanics and relativity. Hawking also speculated on the existence of wormholes and quantum fluctuations linking multiple universes. Hawking's scientific achievements were all the more remarkable because he was afflicted with a debilitating neural disease that kept him confined to a wheelchair, able to speak only with the aid of a speech-synthesis computer. Commander Data devised a holodeck program that allowed him to play poker with Dr. Hawking, Albert Einstein and Sir Isaac Newton. 
In an alternate future experienced by Jean-Luc Picard, Data held the same position at Cambridge University that Hawking and Newton had in previous centuries, and he had a copy of Hawking's book, "A Brief History of Time," in his library.

Played by Stephen Hawking himself. Professor Hawking's appearance on Star Trek was the result of a visit he made to Paramount Pictures to promote his motion picture version of "a Brief History of Time." At Paramount he made known his dream of visiting the Enterprise. Hawking did not only get to visit the sets, but he persuaded Star Trek's producers to let him make an appearance on screen. While passing through the main engienering set, Hawking paused near the warp engine, smiled, and said, "I'm working on that." A copy of Hawking's book, "A Brief History of Time," was in Data's future Cambridge library set in "All Good Things."
