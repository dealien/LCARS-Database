PERSONNEL: Liam Bilby
Agent, Orion Syndicate, Farius Prime

Bilby was employed by Raimus. Bilby's family, a wife and two kids, lived in New Sidney. 
Bilby worked with Miles O'Brien who was working undercover for Starfleet. O'Brien set himself up to be recruited by the syndicate. After proving his usefulness to Bilby, Liam vouched for O'Brien to Raimus so that he could infiltrate the syndicate deeper. O'Brien reported the events that the syndicate had planned back to his connection within Starfleet Intelligence. Of that information was a planned attack on a Klingon Embassy. O'Brien's contact forwarded the information to the Klingons so that they could be ready. O'Brien, who had now grown fond of Bilby, told the man about the set-up in an effort to give him the opportunity to save his own life. Fearing a murder attempt by the Syndicate for allowing a traitor to infiltrate the organization, Bilby continued with the original plan, despite the known outcome. Bilby was later killed following actions undertaken on behalf of the Syndicate. Before his death he asked O'Brien to take care of his pet cat, Chester.
