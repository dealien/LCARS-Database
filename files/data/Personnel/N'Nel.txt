PERSONNEL: N'Nel
Architect, Qo'noS ship yards

A member of the House of Duras, born to Tocheck and Na'Kel, older brother to Dargo. He was born into the House of Duras since his grandfather had allied their Houses many years ago. And as part of that House he had to listen to the commands of the g'ArtOl, Duras. Duras felt that his House would be best served if he had new starship designs in his personal fleet and sent N'Nel to engineering school to learn to do just that.
N'Nel is a large, built Klingon. By Terran standards we would not expect to see such a large person working with computers and design, and working in a foreman style position like N'Nel does. Terrans would expect to see him as a body builder, a bricklayer, or some other extremely physical labor position that would use and help build and maintain his large physical structure.
