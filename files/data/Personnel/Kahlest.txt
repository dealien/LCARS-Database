PERSONNEL: Kahlest

Worf's nanny, or Ghojmok, on Khitomer and the object of K'mpec's advances. She was a survivor of the Romulan attack in 2346. Picard tracked her down at her residence within the old city in 2366 where she would be asked to testify on behalf of Mogh to save Worf. She knew nothing of Mogh's activities on the day in question and therefore was not a very strong witness, but the High Council did not learn of her knowledge and feared what she may know as another survivor of the Khitomer massacre. 
Kahlest and K'mpec had known each other in their younger days where he tried to pursue her. Back then and now she regarded him as too fat.
