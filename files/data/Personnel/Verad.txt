PERSONNEL: Verad

A prospective candidate for hosting a Trill symbiont who refused to accept his rejection, despite 90% of all applicants being turned down. In 2370, he attempted to transfer the Dax symbiont from Jadzia Dax, having employed Klingon mercenaries to take control of Deep Space 9 and forced medical personnel to carry out the required surgery. He did briefly host the symbiont, but when normal control was resumed the operation was reversed. The removal left Verad mentally diminished, and with a different personality. His partner, Mareel, pledged to provide care for the remainder of Verad's life.
