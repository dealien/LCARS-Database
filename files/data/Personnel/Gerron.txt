Maquis, science officer, U.S.S. Voyager

Young Maquis resistance fighter who joined the crew of the U.S.S. Voyager after being stranded in the Delta Quadrant. Gerron's excessive reticence and lack of confidence, plus his scuffed boots, earned him a stint of special field training with Tuvok in 2371.
