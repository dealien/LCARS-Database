PERSONNEL: Robert April
Captain, starship commander, U.S.S. Enterprise

The first captain of the original starship Enterprise. April assumed command when the ship was launched in 2245 and helmed the Enterprise's first five-year mission of deep space exploration. During that time he made first contact with the Lysian Monarchy and the Satarran Rebellion. He was succeeded by his first officer, Christopher Pike, then by James Kirk. April returned to the starship years later to be transported to a planet when the Enterprise was taken through a dimensional rift into a place where time moves backwards, and people get younger as time goes by. When Kirk and his crew were no longer able to maintain the functions of the starship, April assumed command of the starship and returned everyone to normal time.
