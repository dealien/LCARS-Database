PERSONNEL: Rawlens
Chief geologist, U.S.S. Enterprise

This man often accompanied survey teams to planetary surfaces as the department head. He was similarly chosen by Captain James Kirk to attend a mission Alpha Carinae II, but the M-5 computer disagreed and suggested a geologist with experience with the specific type of planet.
