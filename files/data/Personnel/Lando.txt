PERSONNEL: Lando
Commander, Chief Engineering Officer, U.S.S. Sutherland

A calm, easy going Grazerite citizen in charge of engineering aboard the U.S.S. Sutherland. Despite his higher rank than many of the crew, he is a senior officer but not in any real situation of taking command of the starship since he has no desire for command.
Born in the arid plains of Grazeri just after the monsoon season, he was delivered on the planet's vernal equinox.
