PERSONNEL: Lursa

Older, more plotting sister of B'Etor who, after brother Duras' death, together headed their powerful family in pursuit of leading the Empire. She is the mastermind behind her family's fight to head the Empire but is well aware they would likely be puppets as the price of the Romulan support they receive. Leaving their nephew Toral behind, she fled with Lursa when Gowron finally proved victorious in the civil war they'd fomented with Romulan backing in 2368. She'd dropped out of sight for a year until coming to DS9 with her sister to raise capital to rebuild their forces, offering Bajoran Khon-Ma terrorist Tahna Los his needed bilitrium in return for gold-pressed latinum while plotting to sell him out to Garak and the Cardassians once they're paid off. Another capital-raising scheme had them seizing a Pakled magnesite mine on Kalla III, overseen by the Dopterian Gorta, and selling its explosive ore to a Yridian, Yog. Circa SD 47779.4, she had just learned she was pregnant with a son; the father was not specified. A year later, she died with her sister in their Bird of Prey over Veridian III while helping Tolian Soran's trilithium research in order to get a new mega-weapon to reclaim the Empire. Like B'Etor, she traveled armed and had refused at first to relinquish her sidearm on DS9.
