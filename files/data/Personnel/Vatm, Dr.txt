Ph.D, astrophysicist, Nezu

Astrophysicist from the planet Nezu, in the Delta Quadrant, Dr. Vatm discovered that the asteroids bombarding his world were artificial constructions dispatched by the Etanian Order. He accumulated information about their technology, discovering the asteroids were intended to soften up the Nezu for invasion, and that one of his fellow colonists, Sklar, was an Etanian collaborator. In 2373, Vatm was poisoned by Sklar to prevent him making his findings public .
