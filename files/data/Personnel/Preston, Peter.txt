PERSONNEL: Peter Preston
Cadet, Engineer's mate, Starfleet Academy

He is the nephew of Montgomery Scott, and was convinced to join Starfleet by the example set by his mentor. He was excited to be training with his family member.
In 2285 this very young engineer's mate gave his life to save the U.S.S. Enterprise NCC-1701. Preston remained at his post when the other cadets ran. 

Reference: The Wrath of Khan
The ABC-TV extended television version of this movie included the line of dialog establishing the family ties, but was not in the original theatrical release, nor the early video releases. In 2002, the Director's Cut DVDs reincluded the rare footage. 
Played by Ike Eisenmann.
