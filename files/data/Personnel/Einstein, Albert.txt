PERSONNEL: Albert Einstein

Renowned physicist of Earth's 20th century, whose articulation of fundamental principles of space-time, energy, light and gravitation revolutionized human scientific and philosophic thought. The U.S.S. Enterprise-D featured Einstein in various holodeck programs. Reginald Barclay, using his Cytherian-enhanced intelligence, spent a night in 2367 discussing grand unification theories with a holodeck simulation of Albert Einstein. The holographic Einstein was later enlisted by Data in a customized holodeck program that allowed him to play poker with such scientific luminaries as Einstein, Sir Isaac Newton, and Professor Stephen Hawking.
