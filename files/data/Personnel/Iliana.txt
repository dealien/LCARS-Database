PERSONNEL: Iliana Ghemor
Agent, undercover Bajoran, Cardassia Prime

Undercover operative for the Obsidian Order and daughter of Tekeny Ghemor, variously rumored to be dead or in hiding. She volunteered for an undercover assignment on Bajor. She was surgically altered to look Bajoran and underwent mind-control techniques that erased her own thoughts and replaced them with Bajoran memories. Upon her return, Iliana was told to expect assorted drug treatments to revive her original memories so that she could be debriefed and to inform her superiors of her findings. She and her father disagreed with her decision to take on the assignment and that caused him some discomfort. Her current whereabouts are not known.
In 2371 Kira Nerys was abducted by The Order, in an attempt to lure Legate Ghemor to reveal his contacts with the underground movement on Cardassia Prime. They altered her to impersonate Iliana, igniting a father-daughter like bond between her and Ghemor which continued until his death.
