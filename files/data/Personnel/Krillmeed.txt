a.k.a. Krillmeed
Admiral, Intelligence Officer, Starfleet Headquarters

A British-born man living in Germany and senior officer in Starfleet Intelligence. He is in charge of Section 31, a unit named for its use of the 31st floor of the building. He and his operatives have been known to work undercover and have codenames, alias', and access to a variety of special tools within the Starfleet. His operatives are assigned a variety of duties and not dedicated to a specific task so Krillmeed is often owed many favors by others in the Fleet when he has worked personally, or assigned some of his officers to assist others in the field. This broad experience makes him a valuable asset for committees and advising. And he is one of few officers with a passion for researching alternate realities and timelines, so he loves to tell tales about a galaxy far, far, away; or about the Shadowy creatures he hears about that lie dormant for a thousand years then thrive on spreading chaos.
