PERSONNEL: Belongo

Ferengi, nephew of Grand Nagus Zek. In 2371 Belongo was taken into custody by Starfleet authorities on Aldebaran III for what was described as a "slight misunderstanding." Quark, on behalf of the grand nagus, asked Commander Sisko to help clear up that "misunderstanding" with Starfleet while he was visiting Earth to speak at a symposium. Sisko said he would see what he could do, since he owed the nagus a favor, but couldn't promise results.
