PERSONNEL: Nicky the Nose
 
Recurring notorious gangster holo-character in the Dixon Hill holonovel and stories, so named because he lacked a portion of his olfactory organ after it had been shot off. Jean-Luc Picard used Nicky's tommygun to kill two drones that were pursuing him and Lily Sloan during the Borg takeover of the Enterprise.
