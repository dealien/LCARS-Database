Played by Robert Bauer. Many of the images of Kunivas displayed on The Continuum were credited as other characters by mistake. His posting to theT'Acog is conjectural but it has been speculated that the trio were assigned officers that attempted to use the starship for their purposes until the rest of the crew committed mutiny and captured them to turn over to the High Council or other authority.
