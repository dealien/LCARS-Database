PERSONNEL: Gav
Ambassador, Tellarite representative, Tellar

Tellarite ambassador who journeyed aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise to the historic Babel Conference in 2267. At a cocktail party aboard the ship, Ambassador Gav quarreled openly with Vulcan Ambassador Sarek about the admission of Coridan into the Federation. Gav was subsequently found murdered, his body shoved up a Jefferies Tube. The fact that he was killed by a Vulcan technique called "tal-shaya" pointed the finger of suspicion at Sarek, but it turned out Sarek was being framed by an Orion disguised as an Andorian.
