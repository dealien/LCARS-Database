PERSONNEL: Simon Hogan
Maquis, engineering officer, U.S.S. Voyager

In 2372, as a crew member aboard the U.S.S. Voyager, Hogan operated the transporter console when Tuvok and Neelix were accidentally merged into Tuvix. With Neelix no longer as an individual, Hogan was among those crew members who tried to cook their own food in Neelix's kitchen. 
In early 2373, Hogan was killed by a giant Hanonian land eel on planet Hanon IV. Later that year, Hogan's remains were found by Voth archaeologist, Forra Gegan. Dr. Gegan used them as evidence to support his Distant Origin Theory, which suggested that Voth and human people shared a common ancestry.
