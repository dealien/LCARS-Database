PERSONNEL: Natima Lang

Cardassian who was romantically linked with Quark while serving on Terok Nor. Lang was a political dissident and former correspondent for the Cardassian information service. Lang's initial attraction to Quark came soon after learning of his selling food to the Bajorans. Their relationship later soured when she learned of his financial improprieties.
Lang later taught as a Professor of Political Ethics but her political views, not to mention her involvement with the Cardassian underground movement, soon made her an outcast on Cardassia. She, Hogue, and Rekelen left Cardassia Prime under pursuit from the authorities. They arrived at station Deep Space Nine where they hoped to find a safe place to hide. Quark assisted their escape from DS9 by giving them a cloaking device for their vessel. Before they left Lang received several calls from Lieutenant Smith on the station's system- but it turned out to be Quark impersonating the officer since she didn't want to return his earlier calls.
