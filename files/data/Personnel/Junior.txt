PERSONNEL: Junior

A large spaceborne life-form discovered by the U.S.S. Enterprise-D near the Alpha Omicron System in 2367. The creature was composed of an energy field surrounded by a shell of silicates, actinides, and carbonaceaous chondrites. Starship personnel had been responsible for the acidental death of Junior's mother, just prior to Junior's birth. Accordingly, Dr. Beverly Crusher devised a technique to use the ship's phasers to perform a casarean section on the mother's body, allowing Junior to live. Shortly after the delivery, the creature physically attached itself to the ship's hull, absorbing power directly from the ship's systems. Commander Geordi La Forge, with help from visiting engineer Dr. Leah Brahms, was able to modify the ship's internal power frequncies to effectively "sour the milk," thereby weaning the child. Junior was last seen, along with other members of is species, in the asteroid belt near the Alpha Omicron System.
