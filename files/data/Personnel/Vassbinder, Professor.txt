PERSONNEL: Vassbinder
Professor, engineering researcher, Starfleet Academy

Federation scientist, prone to moments of confusion, who once gave a hypnotic lecture on the ionization effect of warp nacelles, then realized his topic was supposed to have been psychology. His students included Wesley Crusher and Chakotay. He had also carried out research into warp field technology, and taught temporal mechanics at Starfleet Academy, a course failed by Chakotay.
