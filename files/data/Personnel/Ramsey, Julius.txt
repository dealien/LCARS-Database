This character wasn't supposed to be given a first name or extensive back story. When the series was first conceived it was designed to be left out to keep the captain a bit of  mystery, to show the isolation between the top officer and the rest of the crew. But when the decision to write the two books for the Captain's Table mini-series was made, a first name had to be thought of, if for nothing more than to have something to put on the front cover. Since then the other books were edited to include a little bit more information about the captain and to show the mentor-relationship between him and the main character.
