PERSONNEL: Albino, the

Ruthless Klingon criminal. 
In 2290, the Albino was nearly captured in a concerted effort involving three famous Klingon warriors, Kor, Koloth and Kang. In retaliation, the Albino used a genetic virus to kill the firstborn of each of the Klingons sent to capture him. In 2345 he was found on Galdonterre but an informant tipped him off to the arrival of the Klingon warriors and fled to Secarus IV. 
In 2370, Kor, Koloth and Kang caught up with the Albino. Kang made a negotiation with the Albino for a fair fight but the Albino planned an ambush for the trio. Kang did not tell his comrades until Commander Jadzia Dax noticed the obvious flaws in Kang's plan and convinced the Klingons on a different course of action. The three destroyed the Albino's energy station and then ambushed the compound themselves. The Albino was killed in the ambush.
