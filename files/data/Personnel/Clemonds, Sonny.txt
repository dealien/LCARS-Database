PERSONNEL: Sonny Clemonds

American country-and-western singer from late 20th-century Earth. Clemonds died of emphysema and extensive liver damage, the effects of extensive tobacco and alchohol consumption. He arranged for his body to be cryogenically stored aboard an orbital satellite, and was revived in 2364 by the crew of the Enterprise-D. He later returned to Earth aboard the U.S.S. Charleston.
