PERSONNEL: Susan Nicoletti
Crewman, engineering officer, U.S.S. Voyager

Human member of the U.S.S. Voyager crew, primarily assigned to engineering under B'Elanna Torres. Tom Paris thought her cold, because she rebuffed his advances. Harry Kim, however, found her quite 'warm' when playing her oboe; the two collaborated on an orchestra holo-program.
