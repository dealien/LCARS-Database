PERSONNEL: Laas

A second changeling discovered by Odo after the being tracked and boarded his runabout. It was discovered that he too was one of "the hundred" sent away by the Founders milennia ago in an attempt to learn about the rest of the galaxy when those beings finally returned home. Laas did not have a positive attitude about "solids" and tried to lure Odo away to go find more of their kind. While Laas accepted Odo's word about the negative aspects of The Founders through the wormhole, he did propose finding the other "hundred" and creating their own Link.
Laas' dislike of solids was not veiled- and he became blatently rude toward them, even to Odo's friends. The division caused Laas to put more pressure on the shape shifter to leave together. While stretching his own abilities Laas turned into a fog and took over the Promenade, which scared and bothered the other inhabitants of the station. Two Klingons in particular took extra offense to the event and started a fight with Laas. Laas stabbed one of the approaching warriors and was taken into custody- later to be charged with murder. Odo, fearing that anti-Changeling sentiments would prevent a fair trial. Recognizing the situation Major Kira releases Laas from his cell and then tells Odo where Laas went to hide. Odo finds Laas, but tells him that he should go on, that Odo will stay with Kira on the Station.
