PERSONNEL: Koru
Prelate, government leader, Qomar Planetary Alliance

Leader of the Qomar Planetary Alliance in the Delta Quadrant. Prelate Koru made a special request to Captain Janeway of the U.S.S. Voyager to learn more about the algorithm expressions called "music," so Janeway arranged for him and some of his people to attend a "recital" aboard her ship. Koru and the other Qomar were particularly taken by the Doctor's singing, to the extent of rudely dismissing other performers at that recital. To introduce the hologram's singing to more of his people, he insisted that the Doctor perform on his planet, which the Doctor had no problem agreeing to. During the starship's stay at the Qomar world, Koru believed their civilization would be intimidating to the less advanced crew, so he made assurances that they would do everything they could to avoid overwhelming the visitors.
