PERSONNEL: T`Pau

One of Vulcan's most revered leaders, the only person ever to turn down a seat on the Federation Council. In 2267, T'Pau officiated over Spock's wedding ceremony that turned into a fiasco. She later saved Captain Kirk's career by telling Starfleet she requested his visit to Vulcan. 
In the mid-22nd century (Earth calendar), T'Pau was a leader in the Syrrannite movement which helped to reform Vulcan society, by bringing forth the true teachings of Surak. 
A Vulcan starship, T'Pau NSP-17938, was named for her. After its decommission in 2364 the T'Pau was used in a Romulan invasion plot. 
In 2373 the U.S.S. Voyager's EMH created a holographic T'Pau as part of his personality-improvement project.
