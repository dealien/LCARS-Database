PERSONNEL: Alice series

A model of android created by the long-extinct "Makers" from the Andromeda Galaxy occupying a planet that came under the control of Harry Mudd in 2267. The pretty brunette model was a particular favorite of Mudd, who had 500 replicas of her made to attend to him. Like the other androids, though, the Alice units deprived Mudd of his freedom in exchange for fulfilling his every need, and planned to do the same for all of mankind by way of the U.S.S. Enterprise. The Enterprise crew thwarted them, however, by behaving in extremely illogical and paradoxical manners, causing the androids to literally short-circuit.

Played by Rhae & Alyce Andrece.
