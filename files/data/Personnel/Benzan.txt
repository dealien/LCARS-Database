PERSONNEL: Benzan

Native of the planet Straleb, son of Kushell, the Secretary of the Legion of Unity. Benzan was the father of the unborn child being carried by Yanar of rival planet Altec in 2365, and was secretly engaged to her. He also was responsible for the missing Jewel of Thasia, a treasure of Straleb, which he gave to his betrothed as a pledge of marriage. Captain Thadiun Okona took the blame for both the pregnancy and the missing jewel, until parties from both planets got together on the U.S.S. Enterprise-D to bring everything into the open and settle their feud.
