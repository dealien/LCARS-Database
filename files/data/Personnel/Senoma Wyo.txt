PERSONNEL: Senoma Wyo
Captain, fleet commander, Grazeri

This captain was in charge of a fleet of speeders used to transport citizens across the great plains of his homeworld before his race acquired warp power and star fleets. He often chose to operate the great hovering cars himself and get the chance to see other parts of his world. This man was also a patron of the "Captain's Table" bar. He had been there enough that he learned to be able to anticipate where the entrance was, or how to find one if he went looking for it.
