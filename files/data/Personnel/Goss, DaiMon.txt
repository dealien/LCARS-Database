PERSONNEL: Goss
DaiMon, starship commander

Leader of the Ferengi team negotiating for rights to the Barzan wormhole. He used several shady ploys, all ultimately unsuccessful. One of his tactics used poison to eliminate the Federation Ambassador, Dr. Mendoza. Goss later made a deal with Devinoni Ral in which the Ferengi would pretend to be trying to destroy the wormhole to give Ral bargaining power so that his acquisition of the wormhole would be made advantageous to the Ferengi.
