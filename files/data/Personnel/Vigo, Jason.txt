PERSONNEL: Jason Vigo

Born to Miranda Vigo and a Starfleet officer in 2346, although Jason never knew his father's identity. Jason and his mother moved to Camor V in 2358, where he was arrested on several occasions for minor offenses. In 2370 to avenge himself on Jean-Luc Picard, DaiMon Bok resequenced Jason's DNA in order to pass him off as Picard's son, planning to kill him once they had bonded. The genetic manipulation prompted Forrestor-Trent Syndrome, which revealed Bok's deception. Jason then returned to Camor V.
