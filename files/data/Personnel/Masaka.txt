PERSONNEL: Masaka

According to the 87 million-year-old legends of the D'Arsay, Masaka was a sun goddess. The D'Arsay archive, referred to as Masaka's city by another character in D'Arsay mythology, programmed Data to act the role of Masaka and used the U.S.S. Enterprise NCC-1701-D replicators to recreate Masaka's temple and other settings in the myth.
