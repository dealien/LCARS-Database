PERSONNEL: Eleen
Regent, planetary leader, Capella IV

Mother of High Teer Leonard James Akaar, and regent of Capella IV's Ten Tribes. Eleen named her son for Dr. McCoy and Captain Kirk, after they forestalled her execution and thwarted a Klingon-led coup d'etat in 2267. Because of the assistance of the Enterprise crew she named her child in honor of two of the away team members, Leonard McCoy and James Kirk.
