PERSONNEL: Atoz

Last inhabitant on planet Sarpeidon before their sun, Beta Niobe, went nova in 2269. Mr Atoz managed a vast library on Sarpeidon, part of his people's atavachron time-travel facility. For this task, Atoz had the assistance of numerous android copies of himself. The library allowed the people of Sarpeidon to select past eras to which they could travel to escape the explosion of their sun. Just prior to the detonation of Beta Niobe, Atoz mistook a landing party from the U.S.S. Enterprise for Sarpeidon citizens seeking escape, and sent James Kirk, Commander Spock, and Leonard McCoy into his planet's past. They were returned to the present, just in time for Atoz to escape into his chosen past.
