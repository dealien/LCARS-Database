PERSONNEL: Shaun Geoffrey Christopher
Colonel, astronaut, Earth-Saturn craft

Son of Captain John Christopher, Shaun led the first successful Earth-Saturn probe. As Shaun was not yet conceived when his father encountered the U.S.S. Enterprise in 1969, it was imperative that the Captain was returned to the proper timeline, and without any knowledge of future events, so that his son could lead the historic Earth-Saturn mission. 

Reference: Tomorrow Is Yesterday 
The character's name was derived from writer D.F. Black's three sons: Shaun, Geoffrey, and Christopher.
