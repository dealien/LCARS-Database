PERSONNEL: Campio
Minister, Conference of Judges, Kostolain

Protocol-bound Third Minister. In 2368, Campio was engaged to wed Ambassador Lwaxana Troi. With their courting taking place on subspace radio, they were only scheduled to meet just days prior to their wedding. Troi, however, effectively backed out of the wedding when she turned up to the ceremony nude, as Betazoid custom dictates, much to the Minister's consternation.
