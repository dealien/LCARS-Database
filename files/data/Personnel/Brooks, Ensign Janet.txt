PERSONNEL: Janet Brooks
Ensign, U.S.S. Enterprise-D

Crew member whose husband, Marc Brooks, died in late 2366 in an accident. Rather than grieve properly, though, Ensign Brooks kept busier than usual, volunteering for extra time in the nursery, excelling in her language studies, and never missing a single hour of her duties. She visited Counselor Troi for a therapy session on what would have been her husband's 38th birthday (Stardate 44356) and realized she had not yet accepted his death. Troi handed her a music box that reminded Brooks of her husband, and caused her to cry for two hours that night. During subsequent visits, Troi lost her empathic powers, and eventually resigned as ship's counselor, but Brooks convinced Troi that she had helped her despite her disability.
