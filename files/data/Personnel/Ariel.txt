PERSONNEL: Ariel
Mistress, Angel One

A member of the female-dominated ruling council on planet Angel One in 2364. Ariel secretly married ex-Odin crew member Ramsey, a move viewed by the council as traitorous, since Ramsey advocated radical reforms to grant equal rights for men on the planet. She then was elected as the planet's Mistress, replacing Beata and her staff of conservatives.
