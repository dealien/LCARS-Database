PERSONNEL: Nel Apgar, PhD
Scientist, Tanuga IV

Tanugan scientist who was developing a Krieger Wave converter on a science station orbiting Tanuga IV when he was killed in an explosion in 2366. His widow, Manua, accused Commander William Riker of complicity in his death, but the Enterprise-D crew member was absolved when a holodeck re-creation strongly indicated that Apgar himself was responsible for the fatal explosion, apparently while trying to kill Riker.
