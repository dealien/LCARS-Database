PERSONNEL: Joxom

Irina's co-pilot in the Terrellian ship that entered the Antarian Trans-stellar Rally in 2377 which the Delta Flyer also participated in. A good-looking male, Joxom's presence made Harry Kim of the U.S.S. Voyager a bit jealous, since he had an attraction for Irina. However, in the middle of the race, Joxom was seriously injured when his console exploded. Voyager's Doctor managed to stabilize his condition, but Joxom was unable to complete the race, so Kim insisted on being Irina's new co-pilot. It turns out the explosion that sidelined Joxom was an act of sabotage on Irina's part, one of several intended to wreck the event and disrupt the fragile peace of the region.
