PERSONNEL: Paul Stubbs
Ph.D, science officer, Kavis Alpha

Astrophysicist associated with the Federation planning an experiment in the Kavis Alpha sector in 2366. His transportation, the U.S.S. Enterprise-D, ran into difficulties that almost ruined 20 years of work. Stubbs had been regarded as something of a wunderkind in his youth, and the resulting social isolation left a lasting mark on him. He created a probe called "The Egg" that was jeopardized by a collection of sentient nanites found aboard the starship. Although Stubbs did not initially recognize the nanites as life-forms, they eventually agreed to cooperate with the execution of his experiement. 
Stubbs was an aficionado of the ancient game of baseball, and he was fond of daydreaming about the game's past glories, eschewing holographic re-creations in favor of his own imagination.
