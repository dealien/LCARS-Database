PERSONNEL: Admiral Chapman

Starfleet officer who is known as something of a cook. When the U.S.S. Voyager received its first datastream transmission from Starfleet Command in 2374, the crew was unable to decrypt it, leaving Captain Janeway to wonder what was in that message — a map, the location of a wormhole, or Admiral Chapman's recipe for the perfect pound cake?
