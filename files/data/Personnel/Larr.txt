PERSONNEL: Larr

Menk medical orderly. Larr assisted the Enterprise NX-01's Dr. Phlox, Hoshi Sato and Elizabeth Cutler when they attended a Menk village to run some tests in hopes of coming up with a cure for the deadly disease plaguing the Valakians. It was Larr who convinced Hoshi and Cutler that the Menk are more intelligent than they are given credit for — he picked up some English simply by listening to the crewmembers converse, and organized some blood samples in a sophisticated way.
