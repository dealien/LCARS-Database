PERSONNEL: Jabin
Maje, Sect Leader, Kazon-Ogla

Jabin was the leader, or maje, of the first Kazon-Ogla sect that the U.S.S. Voyager came into contact with in 2371 after finding themselves in the far-off Delta Quadrant. 
Jabin's Kazon-Ogla sect was based on the surface of the barren Ocampa homeworld. Jabin and his people were searching for water at the time of their contact with the Voyager and Maquis crew members.
