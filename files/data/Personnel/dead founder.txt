PERSONNEL: Founder

This founder died when it could no longer hold its shape and apparently died from stress from trying to maintain its shape longer than normal. It was the lone survivor of a Jem'Hadar attack ship that crash landed on Torga IV. The ship was discovered by Starfleet personnel on a scouting mission with a runabout. A team was beamed down to the planet before Dominion rescue forces arrived. The Starfleeters took refuge in the downed warship- causing the Founder to take shelter by pretending to be ship furniture. The arriving Jem'Hadar troops held off rushing the Starfleet team, under the command of Captain Benjamin Sisko for fear of retaliation that may cause harm to the Founder. When the Founder finally gave in to the stress and died it let out a shrieking scream and the Jem'Hadar soldiers killed themselves in shame. THe team Vorta, Kilana, claimed a small vial of ashes to take back with her as part of what is assumed to be a Founder burial ritual.
