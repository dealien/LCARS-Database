PERSONNEL: Gilora Rejal

Scientist from the Cardassian Ministry of Science. In 2371, Gilora and her colleague, Ulani Belor, worked with Starfleet personnel at Deep Space 9 to test a subspace radio relay station. This experiment was intended to allow communication between the Alpha and Gamma Quadrants through the Bajoran wormhole. While working with Chief O'Brien on the project, Gilora mistook O'Brien's overt display of irritation toward her as an overture to mating, as is Cardassian custom.
