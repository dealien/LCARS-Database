PERSONNEL: Flavius

Popular gladiator in the brutal televised arena battles on planet 892-IV. Known in the arena as Flavius Maximus, he rejected the Roman culture of the planet and refused to kill when he heard the words of the Children of the Sun, and opted to live in a cave along with other believers. He was captured in 2267, along with the Enterprise landing party investigating the fate of the S.S. Beagle crew. Flavius was killed trying to prevent the televised execution of James Kirk.
