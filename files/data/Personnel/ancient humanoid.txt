PERSONNEL: ancient humanoid

This person left a VERY old message encoded into the DNA of various species of humanoids that they seeded onto numerous planets throughout the galaxy. This person knew that it would take a long time and cooperation for someone to put the peices together to find the message. The message explained that humanoids were deliberately placed onto the various worlds as a result of their work; leaving genetic coding on each world they visited. A holographic image of this person was part of the message decoded.
