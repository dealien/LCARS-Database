PERSONNEL: Erika Hernandez
Captain, starship commander, Columbia, NCC-02

Captain of the NCC-02 Columbia, Hernandez met with Trip for dinner, following his transfer from Enterprise to Columbia. She was surprised that Trip accepted the transfer. 
In 2154, Columbia aided Enterprise in its efforts to bring Trip over from Columbia to fix the NX-01's warp reactor. A device planted on the reactor prevented Enterprise from traveling below warp five or else the ship would explode. 
So the Columbia, at high warp, intercepted Enterprise, got into formation, and linked a cable between the two ships, thus allowing Trip -- while both vessels were at warp -- to travel to Enterprise.
