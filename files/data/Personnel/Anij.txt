PERSONNEL: Anij

Ba'ku woman who became close to Captain Jean-Luc Picard after he helped preserve her people's planet in 2375. Anij, like many of her species, was much older than she appeared. This was attributed to a naturally occuring phenomenon that surrounded her planet with metaphasic radiation particles.
