PERSONNEL: The Comic

A holodeck simulation of a stand-up comic who bore a striking resemblance to 20th-century Earth comedian Joe Piscopo. The Comic's holodeck program, RW-93216, was used by Data on the Enteprise-D in his ongoing efforts to understand humor. The Comic tutored Data on how to perform a stand-up comedy routine, but the android still failed to grasp the concept. 

Reference: The Outrageous Okona 
Played by Joe Piscopo.
