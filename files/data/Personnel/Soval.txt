PERSONNEL: Soval

Vulcan ambassador to Earth. Soval has a somewhat stuffy, condescending attitude toward humans, which causes problems for both Admiral Maxwell Forrest and Captain Jonathan Archer. As a child, Archer referred to him as "Ambassador Pointy" which his father chastized him for. Soval objected to giving Archer command of the Enterprise NX-01, and also blamed Archer for the destruction of the P'Jem monastery. 
He was one of a few Vulcans that was capable of performing mind melds despite the cultural stigma against such activity. He used his skill to read the mind of a near-death Starfleet security officer injured in an explosion at the Earth Embassy on Vulcan. In that same explosion Soval's life was saved when Admiral Forrest sacrificed himself to shield the diplomat from the blast.
