PERSONNEL: Mrs Kim

Harry Kim's mother. She cared for nine-year-old Harry when he was in bed with a severe case of Mendakan pox, promising not to leave his side. While the Voyager was still docked at Deep Space Nine she called the starship's captain because Harry had forgotten to take his clarinet with him on his mission.
