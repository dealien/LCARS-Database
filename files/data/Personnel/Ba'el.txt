PERSONNEL: Ba`el

A beautiful half-Klingon, half-Romulan woman born and raised at a secret prison camp in the Carraya System, where Klingons and Romulans lived peacefully together following the Khitomer massacre of 2346. The daughter of Klingon woman Gi'ral and Romulan officer Tokath, Ba'el had her mother's face and forehead, but her father's ears. She also had a sense of racial tolerance unique for either a Klingon or a Romulan. 
Her first contact with the outside world came in 2369 when Worf came to the planet and discovered Ba'el bathing in a pond. She became romantically involved with him while he stayed at the encampment, prohibited from leaving. When Worf was ultimately allowed to go and take several Klingons with him, Ba'el opted to stay behind knowing she would not be accepted by other Klingons because of her Romulan blood.
