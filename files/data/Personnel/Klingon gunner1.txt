PERSONNEL: Klingon gunner

This officer served under Commander Kruge until he was killed for disobeying an order. He was carefully instructed to fire upon the U.S.S. Grissom, but to disable the craft since the commander wanted prisoners. His shots destroyed the science vessel. He claimed it to be a lucky shot- but Kruge felt otherwise and executed him.
