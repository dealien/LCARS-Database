PERSONNEL: John Gill
Cultural observer, Ekos

Federation cultural observer and noted professor of history. As a historian, Gill emphasized the study of causes and motivations rather than dates and events. He was an instructor at Starfleet Academy whose students included Cadet James T. Kirk. 
In the late 2260s, Gill was stationed on planet Ekos, where he conducted a disastrous cultural experiment in which he violated the Prime Directive in an effort to give the planet a more efficient form of government, patterned after Earth's Nazi Germany, but based on more compassionate principles. The experiment failed terribly when those near him were corrupted by power and sought to create racial hatred against neighboring planet Zeon. Deputy Fuhrer Melakon murdered Gill in 2268 when Gill sought to discredit the program of genocide launched against Zeon.
