PERSONNEL: Kohlar
Captain, starship commander

Commander of a Klingon vessel that ended up in the Delta Quadrant after a journey of several generations. When Kohlar encountered the U.S.S. Voyager he assumed the Federation and Klingon Empire were still at war, but learned differently upon meeting B'Elanna Torres. 
Believing the pregnant Torres to be the "Kuvah'Magh" or "Savior," Kohlar orders the destruction of his own ship so that Voyager will take his crew onboard. After some debate amongst his own crew as to the veracity of Torres' identity and a struggle for power aboard Voyager, Kohlar and his people were settled on a Delta Quadrant planet.
