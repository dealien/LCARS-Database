PERSONNEL: Scott McGinnis
Lieutenant, transporter chief, Spacedock

"Mr. Adventure" earned his namesake while posted with Commander Nyota Uhura at a transporter station near spacedock. He was eager to see some excitement, get into the action, "even a surprise or two." 
Uhura cautioned the eager officer to be careful what he wished for, forhe got it when Uhura used her post to aid Admiral Kirk in his effort to return to the Genesis Planet. Mr. Adventure protested to the unauthorized beaming and Uhura responded, in kind, by telling him at phaser-point to get in a closet. He obliged.
