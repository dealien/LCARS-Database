PERSONNEL: Nilz Baris

Undersecretary in charge of Agricultural Affairs for the United Federation of Planets in 2267. Baris was sent to Station K-7 to oversee the development project for Sherman's Planet, and in that capacity summoned the U.S.S. Enterprise to help protect several storage containers of the grain quadrotriticale. The valuable grain was found to be poisoned, and it turned out the culprit was Baris' assistant Arne Darvin, who was actually a Klingon spy in human form.
