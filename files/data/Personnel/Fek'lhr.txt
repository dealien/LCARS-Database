PERSONNEL: Fek'lhr

A mythical Klingon beast that was the guardian of Gre'thor, most commonly associated with the devil in other cultures even though Klingon culture clearly rejects the concept of devil. 
In 2367, Ardra appeared on planet Ventax II as Fek'lhr while trying to convince a landing party from the U.S.S. Enterprise-D of her allegedly supernatural powers. Worf was not impressed.
