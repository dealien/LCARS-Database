PERSONNEL: Alidar Jarok
Ambassador, sector commander, T'Sel Imperial Starbase

Romulan Admiral who commanded the forces responsible for the massacre at the Norkan outposts. Nevertheless, Jarok was a thoughtful man, who opposed policies of the Romulan government that he saw as prelude to an unnecessary war. Jarok was eventually censored for his outspokenness and was assigned to a strategically insignificant posting. There, the Romulan government fed him a carefully constructed stream of disinformation designed to convince him that planet Nervala III was being prepared as a staging base for a massive attack against the Federation. Unable to prevent what he believed to be a major threat to galactic peace, in 2366 Jarok stole a scout ship and defected to the Federation. Jarok persuaded Enterprise-D Captain Jean-Luc Picard to investigate these reports, learning that there was no base, and that the Romulan High Command was testing Jarok's loyalties. In despair over his use as a pawn by his government, and over the loss of his former life, Jarok committed suicide. Jarok said he had done these things to help ensure that his daughter could grow up in a better universe.
When he was first accepted by the Enterprise he adopted the alias of Sublieutenant Setal. During his interogation it was concivered that he knew things that a person in his position should not have known and that there was more going on than what he proposed. He dropped the ruse hoping to build creditability and urge the starship to take action.
