Female human whose logs from her crashed Terellian cargo freighter were later used by an Iyaaran to take on her form in an experiment to experience the emotion of love. 
Her logs kept detailed information about her experiences after the crash of surviving and taking care of the other crash survivor, a man. She apparently nursed him back to health and the two of them fell in love. When her logs were discovered by the Iyaarans it proved to be their first contact with humans. Curious about the many emotions that were detailed in the logs, the Iyaaran ambassador Voval used this template during his mission aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise-D.
