PERSONNEL: Gideon Seyetik
Professor, astronomer

Self-important scientist whose life's work was to re-ignite a sun. He was noted for having terraformed New Halana and Blue Horizon. In addition to his remarkable scientific achievements, Seyetik was an author of a series of autobiographies and a painter known for his flamboyant style. Seyetik was married nine times. His ninth wife was Nidell, of planet New Halana. Seyetik's greatest and final triumph was the re-ignition of the star Epsilon 119 in 2370 which he accomplished by personally piloting a shuttlepod into the dead star to deliver a payload of protomatter. He died as a result.
