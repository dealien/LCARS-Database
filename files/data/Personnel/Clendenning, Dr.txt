PERSONNEL: Clendenning
PhD, scientist, Omicron Theta

This scientist did experiments with gamma scans before he was killed in 2336 during an attack on the planet by the Crystalline Entity. Dr. Clendenning's journals and logs - and his memories - were programmed into the android Data by Dr. Noonien Soong, along with those of his fellow colonists. Thirty-two years later, his knowledge helped Data realize that gamma scans would reveal an antiproton trail left by the Crystalline Entity, enabling the Enterprise-D to locate it.
