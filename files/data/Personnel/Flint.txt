PERSONNEL: Flint

A nearly immortal human from planet Earth, born in Mesopotamia in 3834 BC. Flint was blessed with instant tissue regeneration, which allowed him to live through disease, war, accidents, and other calamities that killed other men. Flint soon learned to conceal his nature, living part of a life, marrying, pretending to age, then moving on before his immortality was suspected. During his life, his identities included Solomon, Alexander, Lazarus, Methuselah, and Johannes Brahms. In 2239, under the name of Brack, Flint purchased planet Holberg 917G, on which he built a castle where he could live undisturbed. Flint grew weary of his solitude and sought a companion who would be as immortal as he. His solution was to construct an android who would be his perfect woman. After several attempts, Flint created an android he called Rayna Kapec. When the U.S.S. Enterprise visited Flint's world in 2269, Flint deliberately allowed Rayna to interact with James Kirk, in hopes that Kirk would stir emotions in Rayna that would permit her to love Flint. Unfortunately, he was too successful. Rayna fell in love with Kirk, then died because she could not bear to hurt Flint. Shortly thereafter, Flint learned that he, too, was slowly dying because he had left the complex balance of Earth's environment. Flint said he would devote the remaining portion of his life to the betterment of the human condition.
