Reference: The Trouble With Tribbles, Trials and Tribble-ations
Played by Paul Baxley. The character's first name is conjectural based on the actor's real name. Episode writer David Gerrold intended the character of Ensign Freeman as a walk-on part for himself, but the role went to Paul Baxley. Gerrold finally got his shot to be part of the original crew nearly 30 years later when he played a background security officer in "Trials and Tribble-ations." Gerrold also played a crewmember when he was cast as an extra for the rec deck scene in "The Motion Picture."
