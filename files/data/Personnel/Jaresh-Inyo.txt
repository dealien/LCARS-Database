PERSONNEL: Jaresh-Inyo
President, Federation leader, Earth

Grazerite president of the Federation Council in 2372. After the bombing of the Antwerp Conference infiltration of Earth by Founders became a major concern among governing officials. President Jaresh-Inyo reluctantly authorized sweeping security measures including marshal law. Jaresh-Inyo faced an attempted coup led by Starfleet Admiral Leyton during this time, using his newly granted powers. Jaresh-Inyo later rescinded the orders when he found that certain acts of sabotage on Earth and elsewhere were set-up by Leyton to foster the paranoia.
