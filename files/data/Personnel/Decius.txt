PERSONNEL: Decius

Junior officer aboard the Romulan bird-of-prey that crossed the Romulan Neutral Zone into Federation space in 2266. Although mid-ranked aboard that vessel, Decius had relatives in high places in the Romulan government, and he used that influence to manipulate his commander into a more aggressive strategy when confronting the U.S.S. Enterprise.
