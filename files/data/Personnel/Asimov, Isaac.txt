In real life, science-fiction write Isaac Asimov was a friend of Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry and was a science consultant for The Motion Picture. Asimov was noted as the author of a series of novels and short stories in which robots operated according to what Asimov termed his three "Laws of Robotics." Asimov's laws suggested that robots would be built with ptogramming to insure that they would 1) not harm human beings, 2) obey human commands, except for commands that would harm humans, 3) protect their own existence, except when such protection would violate the other two laws.
