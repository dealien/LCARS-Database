PERSONNEL: Yedrin Dax

In an unrealized time-line, Yedrin was a descendant of the U.S.S. Defiant crew after an accident stranded them in the past. Yedrin hosted the Dax symbiont after Jadzia. 
When the U.S.S. Defiant continued the "loop" in time, it encountered its own descendants on Gaia. Yedrin tried to manipulate the escape efforts of the Defiant crew so that they would recreate the same accident that caused them to crash and forced them to settle Gaia; which directly lead to Yedrin's life.
