PERSONNEL: Alrik
Chancellor, Valt Minor

The rigidly serious government leader of the Valt Minor system who conducted the Ceremony of Reconciliation in 2368 that ended generations of warfare between his people and the Krios system. In this ceremony he received a gift from Kriosian Ambassador Briam, a bride in the form of a rare "empathic metamorph" named Kamala who was born with the ability to sense what her mate desires and become what he wants her to be. In spite of such an enviable prize, Alrik was not particularly interested in her or the ceremony, being concerned only with the matters of the treaty.
