Pioneering scientist from Andros III who developed a theory about aging that suggested cells broke down out of boredom and needed to be entertained to stay young. His theories were incorporated by Dr. Elias Giger in 2373 when he built a treatment chamber for aging that incorporated Bathkin's theories.
