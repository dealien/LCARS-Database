PERSONNEL: Slade Bender

Fictional character in the Dixon Hill detective stories which Captain Picard of the U.S.S. Enterprise-D played out in the ship's holodeck. Slade Bender retained the services of Dixon Hill (played by Picard) to find his sister Alva. As in the book, the holographic Bender is big: big shoulders, big neck, big fists. He also doesn't like funny things. 

Reference: Manhunt 
Played by Robert Costanza.
