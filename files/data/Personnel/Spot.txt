PERSONNEL: Spot

An orange tabby cat, feline ?, and pet to Lieutenant Commander Data. This particular animal became quite fussy about his meal choices and Data had to spend a lot of time, through trial and error, finding a specific feline supplement that Spot would like; #74 worked best of the 125 different formulas the ship's replicators were programmed to make.
