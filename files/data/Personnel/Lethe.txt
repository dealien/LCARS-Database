PERSONNEL: Lethe
A criminally ill female sentenced to the penal colony on Tantalus V. By 2268, Lethe had received treatments on the neural neutralizer which gave her an eerily soporific demeanor. 

In Greek mythology, Lethe was a river in Hades whose water, when drunk, would cause one to forget earthly sorrows.
