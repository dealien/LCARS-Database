PERSONNEL: Walter J. Pierce
Lieutenant jg, engineering officer, Utopia Planitia

A construction engineer assigned to the fabrication of starships at the Utopia Planitia ship yards orbiting Mars. In 2362, Pierce murdered his girlfriend, Marla Finn, and her lover in a jealous rage. He had caught her and the other man secretly embracing each other. He later committed suicide in the plasma stream of the U.S.S. Enterprise NCC-1701-D. Due to the fact that Pierce had a Betazoid maternal grandmother, he left empathic traces within the Enterprise's warp nacelle control room that compelled others with empathic abilities to also commit suicide. Daniel Kwan was thus affected and committed suicide. During the investigation Counsellor Deanna Troi was also overcome with the telepathic guilt by stopped before she could kill herself.
