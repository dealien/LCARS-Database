Played by Hilary Shepard. Hoya was the first of her people to be seen in a Class-M atmosphere without the breathing device commonly used by her people. It is assumed that Benzite medicine has advanced greatly, or it may be that Hoya is only 1/2 Benzite and more tolerable to the common gas ratios of the alternate environment.
