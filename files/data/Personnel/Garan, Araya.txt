PERSONNEL: Araya Garan

Wife of Hatil Garan, both inhabitants of the Vhnori homeworld. After her husband suffered a debilitating incident that burdened the family, Araya wanted him to undergo the Vhnori transference ritual. She felt Hatil's choice to die in 2371 was a selfless gift to his family. She was angry at Harry Kim for "spreading lies" about the Next Emanation and causing her husband to question, on his deathbed, a lifetime of beliefs.
