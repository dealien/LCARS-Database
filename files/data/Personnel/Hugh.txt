PERSONNEL: Hugh
Third of Five, scout ship operator

"Hugh" was the name given by Geordi LaForge to a teenage Borg rescued in 2368 from a wrecked scoutship in the Argolis Cluster. His Borg designation was Third of Five. From his experience on the U.S.S. Enterprise-D, "Hugh" gained a measure of individuality that later wreaked havoc on the Borg Collective. And during his recuperation crewmen developed an invasive computer program that could be introduced into the Collective through Hugh that would have caused a fatal overload in the entire network of Borg. The plan was vetoed by Captain Jean-Luc Picard who felt it was too unethical to use Hugh as a weapon of mass destruction. Hugh was returned to the crash site where he was reassimilated into the collective.
Hugh's sense of individuality permeated the local group of Borg which resulted in a lack of purpose for the new individuals. The Borg acted aimlessly until Lore met up with them and gave them a new purpose; promising to make them the ideal artificial life-form. Lore conducted bizarre medical experiments on Hugh's associates and he realized that Lore had no idea of how to fulfill the promise he had made, and then took medical care of the injured patients secretly. Hugh then teamed up with the crew from the Enterprise again in an effort to defeat Lore.
