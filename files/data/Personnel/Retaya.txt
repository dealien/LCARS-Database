PERSONNEL: Retaya
Assassin

Hired gun for the Tal Shiar. Retaya planned to eliminate Elim Garak in 2371, but security chief Odo recognized him in time. Retaya's ship later exploded after leaving DS9, probably by the Tal Shiar. This Flaxian chose to use poison to kill Garak- keeping them presented as bottles of perfumes to avoid suspicion. He was given his orders by Enabran Tain to protect the leader from his enemies. Odo was alerted to be on the lookout for the assassin (not by name) by a contact Odo had within the Obsidian Order that alerted Odo that he was investigating something far larger and deeper than the security officer previously conceived.
