PERSONNEL: Klingon judge
Court officer, Qo'noS

The magistrate serving at the "show" trial of James Kirk and Leonard McCoy after the two had been charged with the murder of Chancellor Gorkon. While the two officers were found guilty by Klingon standards, he did consider the upcoming peace conference between the Klingon Empire and the Federation and commuted the normal death sentence. He punished them to the dilithium mines of Rura Penthe without the possibility of parole or reprieve.
