PERSONNEL: Klingon Ambassador
Ambassador, diplomatic officer, Earth

In 2286, the Klingon Ambassador to the Federation tried to extradite James T. Kirk to the Klingon homeworld for crimes against his people, which included the theft of a Klingon vessel. The Ambassador also believed that Kirk was behind Project Genesis and that its intended goal was to be used as a weapon of mass destruction. 
The Klingon Ambassador was again opposed to releasing Kirk and Dr. McCoy after they had been arrested on suspicion of murdering Chancellor Gorkon in 2293.
