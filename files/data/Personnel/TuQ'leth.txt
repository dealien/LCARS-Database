PERSONNEL: TuQ'leth
Councilor of the High Council, Qo'noS

One of the members of the Klingon High Council from the time of K'Mpec to after the Dominion War. His House was in league with the House of Duras during the Klingon Civil War, offering up all his resources in support of the sisters trying to install Toral, son of Duras. He was also the member of the High Council that supplied evidence that Mogh, father of Worf, was responsible for the fall of Khitomer to the Romulans; aware that actually Ja'rod had betrayed his own people. He conspired with Chancellor K'mpec to implicate Mogh in an effort to shame a House that no longer existed and to preserve the power residing within the House of Duras; reminding the Chancellor of the abundance of support that the Duras family held.
In 2374 Dargo sought out the Councilor's help after he had been expelled from Earth and from the Starfleet Academy. Dargo provided him with a tool that he could use to shame the House of Martok, the current Chancellor, by stating that a member of his house, Worf, had acted without honor and against the traditions of their people. TuQ'leth was killed by Worf in the center of the floor of the High Council for his statements against the Ambassador; but his words had been spoken and started a discussion among the other Councilors in support of his initiatives.
