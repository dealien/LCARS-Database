PERSONNEL: 
Captain, transport commander, Merchantman

This man operated the cargo freighter that was chartered by Valkris to transport information out of Federation space and to her "master," Commander Kruge. The vessel waited at set coordinates for a rendezvous with Valkris' supervisor. When the bird-of-prey decloaked the captain and his exec became nervous. Valkris transmitted the data. When Kruge learned that Valkris had seen the data he decided to remove all witnesses and destroyed the Merchantman.
