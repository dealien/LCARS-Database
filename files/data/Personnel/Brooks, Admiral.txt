PERSONNEL: Brooks
Admiral, judicial officer

Starfleet officer with supervisory responsibilities over the U.S.S. Enterprise-D during several missions. In 2369 Brooks was to conduct an inquiry into Dr. Beverly Crusher's activities following the death of the Ferengi physicist Dr. Reyga. Later that same year, Brooks received a detailed report from Captain Picard regarding the Enterprise's encounter with the Borg individual the crew named "Hugh." The report detailed Hugh's reactions to captivity and his development of self-awareness, as well as Picard's decision not to use an invasive program designed to destroy the Borg Collective. The report to Brooks would later cause Picard trouble with Admiral Necheyev, who criticized Picard's choice to return Hugh to the Collective.
