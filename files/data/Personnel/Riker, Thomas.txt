Virtual duplicate of William T. Riker created by a transporter accident on Nervala IV. Following the accident "Thomas," as he was later dubbed, remained on the planet for eight years before being rescued by his duplicate aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise-D. He maintained his current rank and was accepted back into Starfleet and assigned to the Ghandi. He grew unsatisfied with the Federation and its policies, making statements of sympathy for the Maquis. Unable to adjust to his new life, he was recruited y the terrorist organization. He led a team to steal the U.S.S. Defiant from station Deep Space Nine and led the attack into Cardassian territory. His target was a secret shipyard at Alpha Onias III. With the help of Commander Benjamin Sisko the Cardassian Central Command was able to track his progress and trap him between warship loyal to Gul Dukat and Sisko, and warships loyal to the Obsidian Order sent to protect the yard. Thomas was sentenced to the Lazon II Cardassian labor camp following his actions aiding the Maquis.
