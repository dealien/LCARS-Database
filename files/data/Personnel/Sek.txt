PERSONNEL: Sek

Son to Tuvok and T'Pel. Sek has two brothers and one sister. By 2374, Sek had made Tuvok a grandfather with the birth of T'Meni. Sek's daughter was named after her paternal grandmother. 
In a datastream transmission to the U.S.S. Voyager in 2377, Sek revealed in a letter to his father that he had changed his educational curriculum. Exo-linguistics always seemed a little too theoretical to the young Vulcan, so he switched his major to Musical Composition. He hoped that in a future datastream that he could share his latest construct. Unbeknownst to Sek, a secret signal was embedded within his message by the Bajoran fanatic Teero to trigger militant behavior in Tuvok.
