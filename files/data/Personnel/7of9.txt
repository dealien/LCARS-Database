PERSONNEL: Annika Hansen
Seven of Nine, Tertiary Adjunct to Unimatrix 001

The Borg formerly known by the designation "Seven of Nine" has been disconnected from the Borg collective mind through the neutralization of the upper-spinal column neurotransceiver. In total, the Emergency Medical Hologram extracted eighty-two percent of her Borg hardware implants. The remaining bio-implants have been stabilized and remain critical to her life support. The EMH has also stimulated her human metabolism and immune system, though the Borg Nanobots in her bloodstream will more than suffice until she has stabilized. Hair follicles have been repaired and stimulated. Left eyepiece has been replaced by an artificial organ replacement, simulating her own organic eye. 
Starfleet records indicate that Seven of Nine was formerly Annika Hansen. Annika's parents were last reported to be leaving a remote outpost in the Omega sector, headed towards the Delta Quadrant in a small vessel The Raven. It is possible that the Hansen family were the first humans to be assimilated by the Borg.
