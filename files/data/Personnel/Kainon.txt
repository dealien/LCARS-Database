PERSONNEL: Kainon

A petty Bajoran criminal with a pathologic hatred of Cardassians. Kainon murdered Aamin Marritza on Deep Space Nine in 2369 while they were both being held in the same cell. Even though Marritza had been found innocent of any wrong doing, and was about to be released, Kainon took justice into his own hands and killed him for being a Cardassian.

Reference: Duet 
Played by Tony Rizzoli. The Continuum stated that he was a felon with a hatred- escalating the seriousness of his crimes prior to murdering Aamin.
