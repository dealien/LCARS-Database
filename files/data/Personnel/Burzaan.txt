PERSONNEL: Burzaan

One of the Eska hunters the Enterprise NX-01 crew encountered on the "rogue planet." Burzaan was injured during the hunt and treated by Dr. Phlox, who later used wraith cell samples from Burzaan's wounds to create a "masking agent" for the indigenous shape-shifters of the planet.
