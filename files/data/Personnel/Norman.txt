PERSONNEL: Norman

Master of Mudd's androids. Norman commandeered the U.S.S. Enterprise NCC-1701, and crew, in 2267 as the first step in an android invasion. He served as a central nexus for the computing of the various androids about the planet, and was the only android not made in series. Norman was taken offline by Kirk's crazy behavior when he could not understand or predict why the human was acting the way that he did.
