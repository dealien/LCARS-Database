PERSONNEL: Klingon restaurant owner

This jolly man operated the ethnic food gally on the Promenade of Deep Space Nine. Jadzia Dax became one of his best customers after the two of them came to the understanding that she could not be fooled by bad quality gagh. He liked his store to be loud and lively, creating a certain environment that was not always pleasing to all patrons.
