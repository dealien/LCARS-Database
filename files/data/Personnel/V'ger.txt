PERSONNEL: V`ger

A sentient, massive entity which threatened Earth in 2271 en route to find its "Creator," in effect destroying anything it had digitized for its memory chamber along its considerable path. Generating a power field "cloud" about itself of over 22 AUs in diameter, the entity had gained sentience after unknown aliens repaired the old Earth space probe forming its core - Voyager 6, whose name in corrupted English gave the sentience its name. The entity, which viewed organic lifeforms as carbon-based units "infesting" starships, later joined with Starfleet's Lieutenant Ilia and Commander Willard Decker and evolved to a higher, yet unknown lifeform.
