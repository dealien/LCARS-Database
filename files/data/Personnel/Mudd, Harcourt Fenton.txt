PERSONNEL: Harcourt Fenton Mudd
Captain, transport commander

Also known as Captain Leo Francis Walsh.
A human conman, rogue and trader/smuggler of the 23rd century who fled into galactic escapades to escape his shrewish wife Stella. He was 6-feet-1 and 240 pounds, according to Police Record-Code X731248. 
In 2366, James T. Kirk helped send Mudd to a rehab colony after he was caught using the illegal Venus drug to beautify three women he hoped to sell to miners on Ophiucus VI as brides. Mudd's offenses at that time had included smuggling, transport of stolen goods, and purchase of a space vessel with counterfeit currency; the first carried a suspended sentence, while the latter two were treated with psychiatric care whose effectiveness was later disputed. In any case, his ship master's license was revoked on SD 1116.4. 
Mudd was wanted by the Denebians for fraud he committed as part of his "technical information service." He claimed to be selling the rights to a Vulcan fuel synthesizer. He was sentenced to death and broke out of jail. The Denebian police pursued him, fired, and damaged his ship, but he was able to escape.
Eluding that, he caught up with subterranean, ancient androids of a world he later named for himself; they later held him hostage along with Kirk's crew until the captives worked together to escape using illogic. Mudd was left on this planet with 500 copies of a Stella android, and his whereabouts after that point were officially unknown.
