PERSONNEL: Janice Lester, PhD.
Archaeologist, Camus II

Brilliant scientist and James Kirk's former lover who met at Starfleet Academy. She was never granted the command of a starship and felt that it was a result of her being a female.
She plotted to gain control of a starship by using an ancient life-energy transfer machine to swap minds with Kirk in 2269. To lure the starship to her planet, she killed all of her colleagues by exposing them to deadly radiation and sent a distress call. Lester's charade as Kirk ended after ordering the entire senior staff executed.
