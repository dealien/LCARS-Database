PERSONNEL: Iloja of Prim

Serialist poet from the Cardassian First Republic, late 21st or early 22nd century. Iloja lived in exile for a time on planet Vulcan. Tobin Dax met him while on Vulcan, and got the impression that the poet had quite a temper. Tobin became interested in Cardassian literature after that meeting, and Iloja of Prim remained Dax's favorite Cardassian writer in subsequent joined lives.
