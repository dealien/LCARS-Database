RECREATION: Vulcan lute

A Vulcan musical instrument favored by Commander Spock. He enjoyed playing the harp-like instrument during his off-duty hours in the ship's recreation lounges. Spock had even been known to be accompanied by others from the ship's crew like Lieutenant Uhura. Tuvok owned a 5-string Vulcan lute, which he played at home.

A replica of the original prop, borrowed from Gene Roddenberry's office, was used for the movie. A Vulcan lute was seen in the mirror Kira's quarters which was loaned to the show from the personal collection of graphic designer Doug Drexler. It was first referred to as a lute in Voyager. Tuvok said his lute had five strings, but the actual prop had 12 strings.
