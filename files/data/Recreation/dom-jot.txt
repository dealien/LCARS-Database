RECREATION: dom-jot

Billiards-like game with an irregularly shaped table, popular at Bonestell Recreation Facility on Starbase Earhart. Ensign Cortwin Zweller was fond of the game, as were a couple Nausicaans. Jake Sisko's girlfriend, Mardah, said that Jake played the game well. Leeta thought dom-jot was a better game than dabo. She thought Quark's bar should have at least three dom-jot tables.
