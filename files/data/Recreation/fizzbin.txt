RECREATION: fizzbin

A ficticious card game, supposedly played on planet Beta Antares IV, but actually a product of James Kirk's imagination. Kirk fabricated the game to confuse the guards holding the landing party on planet Sigma Iotia II, allowing the landing party to escape. According to Kirk, fizzbin was played with a standard terrestrial deck of cards, but had terribly complicated rules that changed on Tuesdays and involved such things as half-fizzbins, sralks, and, of course, the astronomically improbable royal fizzbin. Ferengi entrepreneur Quark tried to entice Chief Odo into playing the ficticious game in 2373.

It seems unusual that Quark would know of Kirk's bluff, but then again, maybe Quark (like Sisko) was a fan of the legendary starship captain. Or maybe the Iotians developed the game from the partial rules created by Kirk.
