RECREATION: Ressikan flute

A musical instrument from the now-dead world of Kataan. Captain Jean-Luc Picard learned to play this instrument when the Kataan probe passed memories into his mind. He continued to play the instrument after the incident and even agreed to a duet and mutual practice sessions with fellow musician Commander Neela Darren.

The flute itself was a non-working simple aluminum tube. The sound was added during post production. More time was spent making the ornamental case when art department staffers cut holes into many layers of wrapping, then airbrushed and sponge painted the box to give it a porous and textured look. The flute was altered and used in "Nemesis" and placed in a Cherry wood box.
