REGION: Orion Arm

An arm of a spiral galaxy contains billions of stars collected in a denser area than the areas between the arms. The Orion Arm goes through the Romulan Star Empire and through the United Federation of Planets; and is home to Sol and Earth.
 
Reference: Mutiny on the Enterprise
The book states that the arm comes near the Star Empire and says that it was a distant region which is factually incorrect.
