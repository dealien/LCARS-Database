PLANET: Fireworld
SYSTEM:
SECTOR: 221G
QUADRANT: Alpha

One of the major tourist attractions of Thallonian space, the Fireworld remains a major mystery. It has a surface of constant, unending fire that burns and burns without apparently having any source. No one is certain whether the fire is limited to the surface, or whether the entire planet, right down to its core, is one gigantic ball of flame.
