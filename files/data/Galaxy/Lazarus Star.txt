STAR: Lazarus
SYSTEM:
SECTOR:
QUADRANT:

A star that burns out and somehow resurrects itself. 
The Beta Barritus system contained such a star, which was very rare within the Federation, and Captain Jean-Luc Picard had never seen on in person. It first turned into a red giant, exploded in a supernova which destroyed all the system’s planets and created a debris shell, then was reborn as a new red giant.
