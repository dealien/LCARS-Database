PLANETOID: Memory Alpha

SECTOR:
QUADRANT: Alpha

Planetoid home to an advanced computer network and the Federation's largest library. Considered by some to represent the never-ending quest for knowledge. As part of this idealism, it had no defensive weaponry. Contained the total cultural history and scientific knowledge of all Federation members.    Destroyed by the Zetarians in 2269, who were attempting to locate a corporeal body to inhabit. Over three thousand scientists were killed and the central databanks wiped.   Later a plan was proposed to reopen it as a listening post for potential transmissions from other galaxies. The funding was never acquired.
