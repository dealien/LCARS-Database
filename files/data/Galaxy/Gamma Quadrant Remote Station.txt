STATION: Gamma Quadrant Remote Station
SECTOR: Idran
QUADRANT: Gamma

Deep Space Nine Relay station set up on the Gamma Quadrant end of the Bajoran wormhole to establish the Federation's sovereignty over both ends of the wormhole. In 2369, Deep Space Nine's partially destroyed Quarantine Module served as a temporary Gamma Quadrant substation until a permanent post could be built.

It is unclear what became of this relay in the course of the series, but one would assume that it would have been destroyed by the Dominion. Since Sisko didn't notice anything amiss in "The Jem'Hadar", the substation must have been destroyed AFTER those events. Of course that raises the question of why the Dominion would destroy colonies before the substation?.
