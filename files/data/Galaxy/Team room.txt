SHIP: U.S.S. Excalibur

The main crew lounge aboard the U.S.S. Excalibur, located on Deck 7 in the rear of the saucer section of the Ambassador-class version of the starship. Its name was a holdover from a term used in the early days of space exploration. The Ten-Forward Lounge was renamed in honor of this room aboard the Galaxy-class version of the Excalibur.
