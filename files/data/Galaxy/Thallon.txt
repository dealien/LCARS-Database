PLANET: Thallon
SYSTEM:
SECTOR: 221-G
QUADRANT: Alpha

A disintegrated pile of rubble that was once the capital planet of the Thallonian Empire. It was never harmless.
The planet was rich in mineral resources of which the population made extensive use of to fuel their technology and galactic conquests. It was later discovered that the source of the energy rich minerals came from the Great Bird of the Galaxy when it chose Thallon as a nest for its next incarnation. Its energies were transferred to the planet so that the emerging resurrection would be able to feast on the asteroid remains and begin a new life. When the new Bird ‘hatched” it destroyed the planet and ate much of the planet’s crust before flying off.
The population of the planet, before the Great Bird destroyed the planet, was under the rule of a family monarchy for generations. A popular uprising did overthrow the royal government briefly before losing the planet altogether.
