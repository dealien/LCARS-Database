STATIONS: Starbase 1

Located near the Solar Oort cloud; in Ben Sisko's opinion, "the oldest and least useful starbase in the Federation." A surface-based complex with orbiting dry docks in geometric arrays along one side of the planet.  James Kirk spent considerable time here as a young lieutenant.
