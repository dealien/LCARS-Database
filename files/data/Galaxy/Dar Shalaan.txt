A city thousands of years old on the Ta'alaat homeworld, Dar Shalaan was their religious center, home to their most important Anu'anshee shrine.  It was destroyed by the Sarkassian captain Roan S'acree in a tactical counterstrike around the year 2130.  Ta'alaat religious extremists killed Sarkassian scientists studying Anu'anshee artifacts in their shrine.  Some aspect of the counterattack lead to the accidental unleashing of the energies of the Anu'anshee power source; thousands were massacred.  The Ta'alaat named Roan "the Butcher" for what happened, but to the Sarkassians, he was a hero.
