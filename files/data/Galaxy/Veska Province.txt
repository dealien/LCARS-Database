LOCATION: Veska Province

Political subdivision of the planet Bajor. The Shakaar Resistance Cell once camped at the edges of Veska Province.  Shakaar had volunteered to help clean up what was left of a farm community after a group of resistance fighters accidentally detonated a fusion bomb in the valley nearby. There had been little left worth salvaging, and the people had been burnt to death by the blast.
