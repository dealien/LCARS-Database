PLANET: Ondahar VII
SYSTEM: Ondahar
SECTOR:
QUADRANT:

The capital city of this planet was destroyed around 3850 B.C in a catastrophic explosion of an Anu'anshee artefact, killing most of the three hundred thousand people who lived there.  The pattern of the explosion is seemingly random, for Anu'anshee energies do not follow the pattern of linear space-time.
