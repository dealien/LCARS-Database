REGION: Darkshade
SECTOR: 221G
QUADRANT: Alpha

The most mysterious section of Thallonian space. No ship that has ventured into the area has ever returned. The more scientifically minded believe that it is some sort of gateway- possibly to another time, possibly to another dimension. It is believed by some of the more fanciful that it is the source of all evil.

Reference:
The books referred to it as a sector of space; but it was contained within an official sector so the word was replaced with section.
