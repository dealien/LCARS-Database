STATION: Dinai 

A dilithium-refining facility near the Denobulan Cluster.  It was raided by pirates, and the Earth vessel Achilles attempted a rescue.  In the attempt, two Vulcan hostages taken by the pirates were killed, Achilles was badly damaged and its CO, Jon Lyman, was killed, and the pirates managed to escape with a fortune in dilithium crystals.  The hostages were actually killed by Ensign Alana Hart, a member of the rescue team, but Starfleet managed to cover that fact up.
