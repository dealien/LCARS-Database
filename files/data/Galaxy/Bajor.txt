PLANET: Bajor
SYSTEM: B’hava’el
SECTOR: Bajoran
QUADRANT: Alpha

Bajor has five moons, including Baraddo, Jeraddo, and Penraddo.  The moons were first landed on around 1370. Time needed to travel from Starbase 1 to Bajor was eleven standard hours at the Sreba's maximum speed. In 2369, Bajor was under emergency restrictions. It was illegal for any Bajoran citizen to possess anti-establishment material, such as Redemptorist recordings. Bajoran anatomy included a primary and secondary lung lobe, a liver and a post-liver. The race’s culture goes back five hundred thousand years in an unbroken line.  There were no worldwide disasters, great empires, dark ages, or other signs of the natural ebb and flow of history during that time, possibly because of interference by the Prophets.  Ten thousand years ago, when some communities were just about to throw off the religious order, the first Orb landed on Bajor. Bajor possesses one of the most unified religions in existence. Almost all Bajorans believe in the existence of the Prophets and follow the guidance of the Kai.
