REGION: Promethean Space
QUADRANT: 

Populated by a mysterious and advanced race who have a variety of names, depending upon what race you’re speaking to. Large and powerfully built, the members of that race are extremely advanced and have a philosophy that is the opposite of the Prime Directive. Namely, they believe that it is their obligation to impart knowledge to various races who pass through their section of space. Unfortunately, there is also a significant downside to this practice; Thus far, the vast majority of races who have made use of the Promethean knowledge have come to an untimely and fairly ugly end.
