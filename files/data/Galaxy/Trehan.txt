Inhabited by the Trehanna, humanoids with six fingers, and eyes which were split-pupilled. Trehanna woman were clothed head to foot in veils and  forbidden to show their faces to anyone but their lawful husband. Trehanna women were to defer to all males, even those of other species. In Trehanna society, it is inappropriate for women to concern themselves with trade and finance although a Trehanna widow is honor bound to complete her husband's business affairs. Kolovzon and Diaadul of the Helios were both Trehanna.
