LOCATION: Starfleet Academy

Training facility for Starfleet personnel. Many simulations at the Academy were designed to train the cadets' ability to cope with glitches and malfunctions of various sorts. One such simulation involved the unexpected failure of a simulated starship's computerised phaser target-lock. When Jean-Luc Picard took the test, he quickly dispatched a pair of Tzenkethi raider ships by dead reckoning, drawing admiration from both Cortin Zweller and Marta Batanides. Another test simulation involved Captain James T. Kirk's encounter with a Gorn captain. Cadets were supposed to find out how Kirk defeated the Gorn without killing him - and without getting killed themselves. Instructors included Admiral Ammerman First Virtue, Professors Rehling and Galen. In 2323, the Academy's superintendent was a full Betazoid.

Presumably, per the OkudaChron, Galen was Picard's professor at the Academy.
