PLANET: Zantos
SYSTEM:
SECTOR: 
QUADRANT: Beta

This world produces what is regarded as the best ale in the quadrant, better even than Romulan Ale and twice as difficult to obtain. A Starfleet survey team was captured on Zantos by local inhabitants, and the leader was subjected to harsh punitive measures. Allegedly, Starfleet Captain Mackenzie Calhoun snuck onto the planet’s surface and absconded with a case of ale with the Zantos fleet in hot pursuit.

Reference:
The inclusion of the planet into the Beta Quadrant is conjectural, but appropriate since the entry says best ale in the quadrant- and Romulan ale comes from the Beta Quadrant.
