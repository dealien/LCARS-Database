PLANET: Blue
SYSTEM:
SECTOR:
QUADRANT:

A planet about six weeks travel into the Delphic Expanse, home to a trellium mine.  The planet was called that by Xelia because trellium stained everything that color.  The foreman of the north mine, Baloran, did not know the planet's name; he considered it unimportant.  Thirty-one different species, including Xindi, worked in the mines on Blue.  Enterprise NX 01 traveled to Blue because they had heard from a freighter captain that there was a Xindi miner on Blue.
