GOVERNMENT: United Earth Space Probe Agency

Early operating authority for the first starship Enterprise. It was formerly called the AeroNav before the Earth unified under a single government. It later became Starfleet under the United Federation of Planets. It had often been called Starfleet before the creation of the UFP as well, but that was more of a nickname than a proper name for the agency.

Captain Kirk once claimed he was part of this organization.
