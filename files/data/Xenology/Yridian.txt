XENOLOGY: Yridians
LOCATION: Alpha Quadrant
GOVERNMENT: mercenaries/ unaligned

A race noted for its information merchants. Its natives include Jaglom Shrek, Yranac, Yog, and the destroyer crew who sold the secrets of Galen's DNA puzzle to the Cardassians as a new energy source - in transmissions overheard by the Romulans. They are empathetically sensible, unlike Ferengi, Breen, and Dopterians. Natives use disrupters as sidearms. 
During the early crisis in the Demilitarized Zone, Commander Sisko erroneously refers to these traditional information-brokers as the go-betweens for arms deliveries between Cardassia and The Circle on Bajor months earlier; he meant the Kressari. Not surprisingly, at the time his tailor shop is bombed Garak owed money to a Yridian. Constable Odo later had taken a Yridian smuggler into custody and confiscated a bottle of an unspecified beverage from him as evidence. 
Known as Species 6291 to the Borg, yet they determined that the Yridians had become extinct, as had the Federation, but exo-biologist Rudy Ransom made first contact with the race, thereby proving otherwise. (Ransom was promoted to captain and given command of the Starship Equinox as a result of this accomplishment.)
