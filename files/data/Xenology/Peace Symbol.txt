CULTURAL: Peace Symbol

An inverted 'Y' within a circle.  A commonly used symbol on Earth during the 1960's anti-war movement.  The peace symbol was adopted by the underground on Earth during World War 3.  Grayson wore a small silver peace symbol on a chain around his neck.  He gave this to Spock so that others would know that Spock represented him.
