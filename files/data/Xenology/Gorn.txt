XENOLOGY: Gorn
LOCATION: Beta Quadrant
GOVERNMENT: Gorn Hegemony

Civilization of intelligent, bipedal reptilian humanoids. Gorn forces destroyed the Earth outpost on Cestus III, claiming it was an intrusion into their space. The captain of the Gorn vessel and Captain Kirk were transported to a planet by a race known as the Metrons, where each fought for the survival of his respective crew on stardate 3045.6. Kirk won, but refused to kill the Gorn, after realizing that the Gorn attack had been the result of a misunderstanding. The territorial dispute over Cestus III was later resolved, and Federation colonists settled on the planet.
