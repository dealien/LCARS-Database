CHEMISTRY: trilithium

A triatic molecule of the lithium element. Often found in a resin form it is a waste material generated by exposing dilithium to the matter/antimatter reaction within a warp drive's engine core. The material is toxic and unstable, and so is useful only as an explosive. In 2369, terrorists attempted to steal trilithium resin from the U.S.S. Enterprise-D while the ship was at the Arkaria Base's Remmler Array. In 2372 Romulan scientists were working to use the material as a fusion inhibitor and to stop the nuclear reaction of a star. Lursa and B'Etor stole some from a Romulan science outpost to fuel the research being conducted by Dr. Tolian Soren. He sucessfully tested the weapon application of this in a torpedo he launched at Amargosa. He planned to also launch another such equipped rocket at Veridian but was stopped by the U.S.S. Enterprise-D.
