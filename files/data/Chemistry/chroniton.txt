CHEMISTRY: chroniton
 
Particles associated with phasing/ temporal technology. Named for the effect it has on chronology, also known as the timeline.
In 2368 Chroniton particles caused members of the Enterprise-D crew to become phased during a mission to assist a damaged Romulan vessel. The two were able to produce a massive surge of Chronitons by overloading a phased Romulan disrupter pistol in ten forward, prompting Lieutenant Commander Data to flood the space with Anyons and render them partially visible again. 
In 2371 Chroniton particles caused a transporter accident which threw Captain Sisko, Doctor Bashir and Lieutenant Commander Dax to be thrown back in time to the 21st century. Shortly afterwards Chroniton particles caused Chief O'Brien of Deep Space Nine to make several short jumps into the future.
