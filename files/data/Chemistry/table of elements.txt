CHEMISTRY: table of elements

The periodic table of elements is a chart listing the basic atoms known to Federation science. The charts are organized by atomic weight, number of electrons on a valence level, and number of neutrons. The universal charting system replaced previous charts from individual worlds to take into account the larger variety of elemental items found throughout the galaxy. Earlier charts listed only those elements native to a specific planet. And earlier charts often indicated only hydrogen or deuterium, but not both. The multiple chart system used by the UFP places all atoms with no neutrons into a chart, and sorts all other known elements based on the number of neutrons included in the nucleus. Some elements have not yet been discovered but their existance is not predicted.

Reference:
The table was one of the unique items sent to me from a team member, and its origin is unknown. The chart LOOKS like a Terran table but includes a lot of items not seen before and arranges them differently than the original chart. The chart does not actually correspond to the above description completely either.
