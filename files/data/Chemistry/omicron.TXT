CHEMISTRY: omicron
 
A possible alternative power source for Federation starships, omicron particles where detected in 2371 within a nebula by the crew of Voyager. The particles turned out to be part of the circulatory system of the nebula, which was a living being. Omicron particles are also associated with some forms of holographic technology.
