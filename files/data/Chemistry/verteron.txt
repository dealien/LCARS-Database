CHEMISTRY: verteron
 
Verterons are highly damaging to subspace equipment; in 2369 the Enterprise-D was disabled by a Verteron pulse deliberately caused by a pair of scientists anxious to prove that warp drive was damaging the fabric of space-time. Verteron emanations are also associated with wormholes.
