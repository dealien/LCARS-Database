CHEMISTRY: hytritium

A highly unstable substance not carried onboard Federation vessels, but the only known substance capable of neutralizing poisonous tricyanate. The Zibalian trader Kivas Fajo had this compound in stock when the U.S.S. Enterprise was called upon to neutralize such a serious calamity in the water supply on Beta Agni II in 2366. The hytritium in pure form had to be shuttled from ship to ship because of its instability for transporters.
