SHUTTLECRAFT: Scorpion

The Scorpion shuttle provides Reman forces with a sleek, short-range attack ship, that can engage the enemy as one would in a 20th-century dogfight. 
Located in a massive hangar bay aboard their mother ship, the Scimitar, the shuttle is a two-manned craft, armed with a forward disruptor cannon. 
The ship is very maneuverable, as Captain Picard and Data discovered when they commandeered one of the craft to make their escape through the labyrinth of corridors that comprise the Scimitar.
