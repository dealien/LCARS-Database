CLASS: Conial
TYPE: medium cruiser

A Vulcan defense ship designed after the Excelsior class starship, part of the Starfleet-Vulcan hybrid series. These ships were built when many systems still felt the need for independant support of Starfleet's defenses. They remained in Vulcan space, guarding the homeworld and its system for decades in their same condition, receiving only necessary repairs and maintenance over the years. After the Romulan attempt to overthrow the government in 2369 the Vulcan Security Minister, Satok, ordered heavy upgrades in weapons, shields, and other tactical support services to these ships.
This ship is built on one main section, and is thicker than the Dial class ships that were developed at the same time. 
Featuring the typical radial warp nacelle, the main hull is suspended in the center of the circle and supported by a pair of pylons that extend equally to each side. The supports connect to the engineering section where the matter/ anti-matter reaction chamber is housed. At the aft was the shuttlebay which extended in a bulge over the rest of the hull. Forward of main engineering were the fuel tanks and many of the ship's cargo holds are resource rooms. At the bow was the main deflector.
Immediately atop the engineering hull was the main saucer. It contianed the bridge, crew facilities (quarters, sickbay, galley, rec centers, etc) and science labs. The weapons systems were also contained on the saucer in the same fashion as its model. After upgrades were made i n 23## type 11 phaser strips were added to the hull, and the forward facing photon launchers were replaced with quatum capable devices and magazines. The original phaser emitters were removed and replaced with pulse phasers. The main saucer also included the ship's two impulse drives.

This ships is conjectural.
