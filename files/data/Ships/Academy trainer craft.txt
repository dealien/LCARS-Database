SHUTTLECRAFT: Academy trainer craft

Academy cadet ships are small, one-pilot, blunt-winged vessels, with a fairly flat cross-section. They are atmospheric capable vessels used by the Starfleet Academy for the education of its cadets. Most of these craft are located at the Academy's flight range in orbit of Saturn. 
They are used by Starfleet Academy's top Nova Squadron; the pilots wear flight helmets. The craft are equipped with landing struts, proximity alarms, and emergency transporters.
