CLASS: Vor'cha
TYPE: Heavy Cruiser

A Klingon attack cruiser and a major Klingon design, first seen as K'mpec's ship in 2367, about three fourths the length of a Galaxy-class starship. It echoes the traditional Klingon battle cruiser design, but with a foredeck protrusion and, reflecting newly shared technology with the Federation, carries Starfleet-like warp nacelles. As with its Starfleet counterparts, it also carries a mission recorder. These ships are usually equipped with cloaking devices but have rarely been seen using one. And they can be equipped with a poleron torpedo launcher, modified from Jen’Hadar weapons.
The explosion of one within the 15 kilometer distance from Deep Space Nine to the wormhole briefly overpowered the station's inertial dampers. 
The Mirror Universe Klingons also fly this variety of ship. One ship's crew spied and boarded Major Kira Nerys' runabout the minute it exited the wormhole, though no one knows of the anomaly's existence; the same or another of the class pursued the fleeing craft later, firing the familiar green disrupter bolts from the forward wing tips.
