SHIPS: Doomsday machine
TYPE: Dreadnought

Also known as the planet killer, this ship was an automated space-going weapon from outside the Milky Way that entered Federation space on 2267, destroying the planets in star systems L-370 and L-374. Several kilometers in length, with a hull composed of pure neutronium, it smashed planets into rubble with an antiproton weapon, and used the matter as fuel. The hull was so well constructed that direct phaser blasts caused no noticeable damage to the craft.
Enterprise Captain James T. Kirk theorized that it was a weapon, a doomsday machine built primarily as a bluff used in a war uncounted years ago in another galaxy. The civilization that built the planet killer might have gone, but the machine continued to destroy. Initial projections suggested that the planet killer's course, if unchecked, would take it toward the Rigel colonies and the most densly populated part of our galaxy, putting billions of lives at risk. The ancient weapon was finally destroyed when Kirk sent the hulk of the U.S.S. Constellation to explode in the planet killer's interior, destroying it.
