SHIPS: Reyab
TYPE: transport

Kobliad transport ship, apparently requiring only a pilot and small enough to be towed by a Runabout, whose distress call by security officer Ty Kajada was answered by the runabout Rio Grande after convicted murderer Rao Vandika set fire to his cell in an escape bid and the ship's Central Power Linkage exploded. The ship was towed to Deep Space 9 and was checked there at Kajada's order for anomalous life-forms, not trusting Vantika's apparent death.
