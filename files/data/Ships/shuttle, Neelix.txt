SHUTTLECRAFT: Neelix`s

Small, cramped craft used by Neelix for his salvage and junk trade, taken aboard the U.S.S. Voyager after he and Kes joined the crew. The long boxy craft, with little if any weaponry, can carry at least six bodies. He had flown it to Sobras, and covertly flew it to rescue Kim and Paris from the Akritirian prison station.
