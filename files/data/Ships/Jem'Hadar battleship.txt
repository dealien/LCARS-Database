SHIPS: Jem`Hadar battleship

One of these massive Dominion warships was used by Gul Dukat in 2363. Dukat brought the ship to Deep Space Nine, hoping that Captain Sisko would be persuaded to release Cardassian rebel Ghemor. 
In 2374, Cadet Tim Watters tried to destroy this immense warship. Watters was in command of the Valiant at the time. He and his most of his crew perished in the attempt.
