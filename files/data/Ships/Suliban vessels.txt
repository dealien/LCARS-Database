FLEET: Suliban vessels

Cell ships are the various modular ships that connect to form the Suliban Helix. They have directed energy weapons, but individually they are not a match for the polarized plating of the Starfleet's 22nd Century technology. Several of these ships can easily overpower the shields however. These ship have been known to be equipped with cloaking devices but it is not known if all of them are so equipped.
The Enterprise NX-01 captured a single-pilot cell ship, which Captain Archer and Commander Tucker flew while trying to rescue Klaang from the Helix. A fleet of these ships followed the Enterprise after they learned how to detect through their cloaks in an effort to capture a ship from the future rescued by the cruiser.
