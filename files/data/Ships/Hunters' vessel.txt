SHIPS: Hunters` vessels

Only one kind of ship from this culture has been seen by Federation citizens. It visited Deep Space Nine after coming through the wormhole in pursuit of another craft. The vessel used by Tosk's Gamma Quadrant pursuers had a flatter, rounder and sleeker design than his own ship but it displayed the same ionized L-band emissions. It featured a modulated particle scanning beam, displayed phased power fluctuations preceding its transporter usage, and had a polarity-reversing beam weapon of unknown radiation of very rapid magnetic flux variations. When fired in pulses and later a continuous beam, it affected Deep Space Nine's shields and set off an automatic red alert.
