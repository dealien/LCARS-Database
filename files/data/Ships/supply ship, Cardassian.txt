SHIPS: Cardassian supply ship

A lightly-armed vessel crewed by 50. One, identified on Enterprise sensor graphics as "89459324," is pursued and destroyed by the U.S.S. Phoenix even with the suicidal interference of a Cardassian warship. Another is later hunted down but saved when the Phoenix is forced to halt.
