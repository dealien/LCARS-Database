SHIPS: Philadelphia
TYPE: Naval

A gunboat in the United States Continental Navy in October, 1776.  The fleet was under the command of General Benedict Arnold, and consisted of three schooners, four galleys, eight fifty-four foot gondalas, and a sloop-of-war (the Enterprise), sixteen ships in all.  On October 11, along with the rest of the fleet, clashed with the British Royal Navy at Valcour Island.  The Philadelphia sustained major damage during the battle, and sank beneath the waves later that evening.

Reference: Veil at Valcour 
Referred to as a "gunboat" in this story, historical records identify the Philadelphia more precisely as a gondala type vessel.
