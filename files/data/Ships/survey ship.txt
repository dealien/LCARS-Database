SHIPS: survey ship

Officially known as a scout type vessel, survey ships are often civilian based craft that are contracted to collect data on a specific planet that is being considered for colonization, or to chart star systems.
A United Federation of Planets survey ship was only one of two ships to have left Deep Space Nine in the hours after Ibudan was found murdered, on stardate 46421.5.
