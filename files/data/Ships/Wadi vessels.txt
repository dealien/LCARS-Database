FLEET: Wadi vessels

The flat, wedge-shaped ship with blue exhaust vents that brought the first formal contact from within the Gamma Quadrant was warp-capable and durable enough to survive the wormhole in good shape, yet small enough to use a Deep Space Nine docking port rather than a pylon mooring. Drawing on an unusually intense bipolar current, the transporter/hologram generator used to power the Wadis' Chula game and contain the senior officers' maze was on its Deck 2 and during their Deep Space Nine visit was set to take the user right to Quark's bar.
