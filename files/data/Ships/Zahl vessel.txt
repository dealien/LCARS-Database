FLEET: Zahl vessels

Cruisers protecting an area of space in the Delta Quadrant. These vessels were responsible for protecting their space against the Krenim, which also claimed their space. The Zahl defeated the Krenim until Annorax created a new temporal warship which used time displacements to defeat his enemies.
