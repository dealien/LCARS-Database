CLASS: Shrike
TYPE: scout

This extra long range scout is used by the Tal Shiar for their covert missions. The transporter systems on these ships have been modified to work while a target's shields are raised, allowing them to secretly board alien stations and vessels.
One such vessel transported the Romulan spy onto a Klingon prison to retrieve the scientist, Dr. Oldan, so that he could resume work on secret Romulan weaponry.
