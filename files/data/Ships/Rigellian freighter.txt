SHIPS: Rigellian
TYPE: freighter

Ship from one or a combination of the many inhabited Rigel planets, who were already conducting business through the wormhole by the time Croden was to be returned to his Gamma Quadrant world in 2369. The ship was used to run interference to hide the Runabout that Croden was moved in from the scans of departing ships by Ah-Kel, the vengeance-seeking Miradorn whose twin Croden killed. Large enough to be docked at a Deep Space Nine upper pylon, its design was flat like a blunt arrowhead, with sides that tapered outward to a midline and a small nosepiece that was tilted down with blue glow at the tip. 
A different kind of Rigellian freighter was one of the first victims of the Romulan's drone ship. In an effort to start a war amongst the humans, the Andorians, and the Tellarites, a drone ship used its holo skin of Enterprise during its attack on the freighter. The Rigellian vessel was destroyed, but not before sending out a video record of its attacker.
