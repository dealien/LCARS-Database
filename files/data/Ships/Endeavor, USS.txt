The last of the 20 ships to leave space dock before setting out to blockade the Romulans supporting the Duras faction in the Klingon civil war on stardate 45020.4; the Endeavour took a primary position that just mirrored that of the Excalibur. 
While on a mission in the Cleon Sector the ship was supposed to rendezvous with Commander William Riker, under Etana Jol's Ktarian plot to take over the Federation, and spread the mind-controlling game to the ship.
The Endeavor took part in the battle to repel an invading Borg Cube in the Typhon Expanse in 2373.
