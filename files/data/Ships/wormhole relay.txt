STATIONS: Wormhole relay

Through a joint venture with the Cardassian science ministry, the Bajorans, and the Federation, a communications relay satellite was launched at the far end of the Bajoran wormhole to provide telemetry to the residents at the Alpha-end of the portal. This information would provide advance warning of incoming fleets, relay science and tactical data, and assist with help if a vessel became stranded on the other side.
