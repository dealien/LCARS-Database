SHIPS: Kriosian ship

The brown-tinged vessel that comes to ferry Ambassador Briam home has a flat, long angular body with a tapered front and four panels at right angles projecting outward at its midsection, much like a Talarian or T'Lani ship. 

Reference: The Perfect Mate 
This vessel was a modified reuse of the Talarian and T’Lani ships. This one had its wings up and down, and out to the sides while the others were diagonally placed.
