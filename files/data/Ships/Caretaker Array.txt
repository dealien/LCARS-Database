STATIONS: Caretaker Array
CLASS: Nacene

A large spaceborne station created by the Nacene. Two such stations were discovered by the U.S.S. Voyager while in the Delta Quadrant. One was in the Ocampa System and worked to provide the local population with energy and supplies as repayment for a failed experiment that ravaged the surface of their world. The resident of that facility used the incredible power of the station to pull starships from various locations in the galaxy to the Ocampan space. The U.S.S. Equinox was also captured in this way.
A second array was found many sectors away, and was home to a group of Ocampa that were taken from their home by Suspira, the other Nacene citizen that helped build and operate the first array. Here she helped the Ocampans develop their mental abilities in hopes that it would help that society.
It consisted of a central cylinder with projecting arms at the midpoint, each tipped with a fin-like panel at the extremity whose plane lies perpendicular to the central axis. The Caretaker used the array to scan the galaxy with a coherent tetryon beam for a likely mate and successor, then abducted the targeted crews for about three days of medical testing for DNA procreation compatibility.
