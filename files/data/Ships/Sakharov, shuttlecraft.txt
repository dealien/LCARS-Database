Dr. Pulaski and Data used this craft as a fail-safe environment beyond the Enterprise-D to examine David, the oldest of the genetically bred "superyouth" suspected of carrying the hyperaging disease. 
Q commandeered the Sakharov in 2366 during an attack by the Calamrain against the Enterprise-D. The real target of the attack was Q. Although the Enterprise-D was saved, the craft shuttle was not.
