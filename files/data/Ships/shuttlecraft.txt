TYPE: Shuttlecraft

Small transfer craft used to move personnel and cargo from ships, stations, or planetary surfaces. Most starships and stations are assigned a contingent of these craft for missions that the entire ship does not need to, and cannot go on. These vessels have been used for scouting purposes, reconnaissance, and as lead vessels through dangerous space in addition to their normal duties.

Reference: all episodes of Star Trek
While transporters were developed to avoid the use of shuttlecraft for every episode, they were used to add variety to the storylines and, I assume, because they were expected to exist.
