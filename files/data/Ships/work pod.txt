SHIPS: Work pod
TYPE: workbee

An early version of the starship support vessel “workbee”. These vehicles were used for extra-vehicular repairs, construction, and services too cumbersome or difficult for manual technicians. These early craft employed two pilots; one for vessel operation (to move the craft, maintain life support, and other critical needs) and one for task operation (to operate the mechanical arms, welder, and similar tasks).
Many revisions of the vehicle were put into service over time, some with specialized duties or modifications of the original model for dedicated tasks.
