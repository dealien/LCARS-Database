SHIPS: Aries, U.S.S.
CLASS: Renaissance

Riker turned down command of this starship when it is offered upon her captain's retirement, circa stardate 42686.4. At the time, it is assigned to the Vega Omicron sector. 
This ship was the last assignment for crew member Mendez before her disappearance in 2367, possibly associated with a mission she served on during her time aboard the U.S.S. Victory to Tarchannen III.
The Aries was named for the Terran constellation (the Ram) of the same name, as well as for the moon landing shuttle from the motion picture 2001: A Space Odyssey.
