SHIPS: Somraw
CLASS: Raptor

The Somraw is a Klingon scout ship, Raptor-class. The Enterprise NX-01 encountered the Somraw inside a Class-9 gas giant, where the ship was floating and apparently derelict. 
Hoshi Sato, Malcolm Reed and T'Pol investigated the vessel, and eventually managed to save it and its surviving crew. The Klingons, however, were anything but grateful.
