SHIPS: Vulcan Scoutcraft

Exploratory spacecraft utilized by the Vulcan Offworld Service.  The scoutcraft commanded by T'Lera crashed in Earth’s Pacific Ocean in 2045 when the destruct sequence malfunctioned.  A Vulcan scoutcraft is typically equipped with four retro-thrusters designed to work in tandem so that as many as one on either side can malfunction without radically impairing ships functions.
