SHIPS: Romulan drone

This drone ship announced an early Romulan presence in the Alpha Quadrant. With the Romulan race virtually a mystery, they used this advanced drone ship to start a war between the Andorians and the Tellarites. 
Archer and Enterprise first encountered the ship while transporting a group of Tellarites to the neutral planet of Babel, where Earth was to settle a long-standing trade dispute between the Andorians and the Tellarites. The ship, equipped with a holographic skin emitter, used the skin of an Andorian vessel and attacked Enterprise.
The drone ships were part of a Romulan project, which used a modified design of the warbird to attack enemies with no trace of Romulan involvement. The ships possessed advanced weapons and the ability to self repair. By eliminating the need for soldiers to be recovered or prisoners to be captured, the Romulans devised the prototype of the perfect weapon.
All of the drone's command functions originate from Romulus, inside a command center identical to that aboard the physical ship. Gareb, of the Aenar, a sub-species of the Andorian race, used a synaptic interface (telepresence) to pilot the ship as Romulan officers waged their attacks.
Soon after the initial attack, Enterprise located the motionless drone ship. Trip and Reed boarded the vessel to investigate, and attempted to disable her during and after its attack on a Rigellian freighter. The drone ship used its NX-01 skin during this attack.
Soon after realizing that there are multiple drone ships and that the Romulans have used him, Gareb attacks one drone ship with another. Romulan scientist, Valdore, who ran the control center from Romulus, shoots and kills Gareb for failing the mission.
Eventually, Enterprise destroys the last drone ship.
