SHIPS: Cardassian freighter

Several different designs used by the Cardassian Union for moving heavy cargo throughout their space.
A Cardassian design as seen with the Bok'Nor and as used by Natima Lang's underground leaders to escape an ambush by the Cardassian military. It is of a utility design similar to one in use for a century by various races. Small enough to use the Deep Space Nine docking ring ports but big enough for the upper pylons, it can still go Warp 8 - even with the small cloaking device installed in its central engine core. Its impulse engines use a fusion generator, with cross-feeds. 
A neutral Cardassian freighter was attacked by the Klingon Kriosian rebels near the Ikalian asteroid belt, leading to suspicion the rebels are based there
