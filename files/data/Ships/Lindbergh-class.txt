SHUTTLECRAFT: Lindbergh-class
TYPE: OR-3 space shuttle

Known as the "Space Ferry", it took over the shuttle series as the primary Earth surface to orbit craft. Early versions were equipped with booster rockets, much like the OR-1-class shuttles, but advances in early 21st-century technology eliminated the need for them. The Space Ferry played a vital role in the completion of the Orbital Power Satellite network that guaranteed energy-independence for Earth and also in the construction of orbiting satellite-cities.

The connection to the ship seen in the opening sequences of Enterprise is conjectural, but the similarities are close enough that I feel it is reasonable to make the statement.
