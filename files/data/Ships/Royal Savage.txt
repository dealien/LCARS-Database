SHIPS: Royal Savage
TYPE: Naval

A schooner in the United States Continental Navy in October, 1776.  The fleet was under the command of General Benedict Arnold, and consisted of three schooners, four galleys, eight fifty-four foot gondalas, and a sloop-of-war (the Enterprise), sixteen ships in all.  On October 11, along with the rest of the fleet, clashed with the British Royal Navy at Valcour Island.  The ship had to be abandoned after running aground on Valcour Island.  She was then recaptured by the British and turned against the Continental fleet, firing upon the Enterprise.  A crewman aboard the Enterprise named Thorsby had helped to re-rig the Royal Savage earlier.  That evening after dark the British set fire to the Royal Savage.
