CLASS: Tahl’rax
TYPE: light cruiser

An early Romulan design developed after the end of the Klingon-Romulan alliance. This vessel demonstrated significant Klingon inspired engineering including the neck and head. And typical of its smaller warships it was painted with the bird-of-prey markings under the “wings” that supported the nacelles.
