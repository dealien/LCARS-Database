SHIP CLASS: Odysseus

Federation class of Starship in use around the turn of the 24th century. Only eight were ever built, launched in the 2270s and 2280s. Their warp nacelles were curved, representing an experimental design that had been intended to make use of new efficiencies in warp-field generation, but those efficiencies never materialised. In 2311, only two were still in service, and one of them, the U.S.S. Agamemnon, had been rumoured to be decommissioned when it was destroyed by the Tomed Incident shockwave.
