SHIPS: naval craft

A type of ship used to traverse large bodies of water on a planet’s surface. These are more common in pre-warp civilizations. Many starships in the United Federation of Planets have been named in honor of famous naval vessels used throughout Earth’s history; including the U.S.S. Enterprise.
Many different kinds of naval vessels usually exist including those that use wind sails, internal combustion engines, and nuclear power. Some have been made from wood and some from metal.
