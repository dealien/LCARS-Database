CLASS: Marshall
TYPE: destroyer

the ambush and loss of the U.N.S.S. Patton began the Romulan war. The Marshall-class was the Earth’s staunchest line of defense, and these ship’s superior performance and firepower provided a crucial tactical edge. In fact, the class supposed to succeed it could not better its specifications and so was never built, the reason the Marshall class had the longest commissioned lifespan before the formation of the United Federation of Planets. This was the first craft to feature warp-generated defensive shielding.
