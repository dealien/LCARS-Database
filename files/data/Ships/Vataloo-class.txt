CLASS: Vataloo
TYPE: fighter

An early developed space capable attack ship used by Bajoran militiamen before the Cardassian occupation. These ships were the most plentiful when the Cardassian forces arrived and were heavily targeted. They led most attack runs against the far superior Galor class warships of their adversary. When the war reached the point of no return pilots broke formations and took their fighters to hidden lairs to be used in future resistance efforts. These ships were not intended for long periods in space since they featured no life support. Air tanks were fitted in the machines to allow for several hours of breathable air for the pilots.
The craft features a main fuselage like an early Earth aircraft. The bow section of the craft features the two seat command section. The nose of the craft is equipped with air canisters and lines are run to each of the two pilots. Behind the pilots were the fuel tanks that fed the fusion reactors that powered the ship. Aft of the fusion reactors were the impulse drivers. Aside of the fuselage were air intakes on each side to assist the engine with its cooling and was vented at the rear to allow for steering control. From the very far end of the craft, out each side of the tail section were power lines that ran to weapon cannons under each wing.
