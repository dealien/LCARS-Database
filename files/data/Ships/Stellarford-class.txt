The most luxurious star-liner ever conceived, the U.N.S.S. King Charles set a standard of opulence and comfort still unsurpassed. It had double the passenger capacity of previous declaration-class space-liners, and its much greater range opened up the galaxy to all peoples. Catering especially to the burgeoning tourist industry, these Stellarford series ships made excursions to such galactic wonders as the Jewel Stars.
