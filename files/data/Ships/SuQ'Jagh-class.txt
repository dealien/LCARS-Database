CLASS: SuQ'Jagh
TYPE: medium cruiser

A Klingon assault vessel created during the last Klingon expansion campaign was originally designed for planetary assaults. Its role has since been modified to accommodate ship-to-ship combat focusing on boarding and taking over enemy vessels. The SuQ’Jagh is armed with multiple photon torpedo launchers and is crewed with the bravest close-quarters combat warriors in the Empire.
The SuQ’Jagh can be modified to launch pods of commando teams onto enemy ships. These pods are capable of penetrating enemy shields, allowing a squad of Klingons to board and attack an enemy ship from the inside.
