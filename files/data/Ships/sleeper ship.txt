SHIPS: sleeper ship
TYPE: transport

Spacecraft in which the crew hibernates in suspended animation or a reduced-metabolism coma during the journey, which is often slower-than-light. Khan's ship, the S.S. Botany Bay, was a sleeper ship, as was the Klingon I.K.S. T'Ong. Earth stopped using sleeper ships by the year 2018 because of advances in sublight propulsion.
