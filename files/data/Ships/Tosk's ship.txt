SHIPS: Tosk's vessel

Small one-person craft with origins in the Gamma Quadrant; Chief O'Brien was able to discern it had been hit at a 45-degree angle to the hull, slicing through two propulsion systems: its Coladium flow through the ramscoop-like Arva Nodes needed repair. Its engines give off ionized L-band emissions, like the Hunters' ship, and it has a reactor that has to "cool down" for repair. Its interior is mainly a large cockpit with a forward console and a floor hatch, raised automatically from a console control. The floor hatch leads to the engine pit.
