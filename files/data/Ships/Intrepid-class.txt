CLASS: Intrepid
TYPE: Light crusier

The class of starship that includes the U.S.S. Voyager. The Intrepid-class starships are 345 meters in length, have a sustainable cruise velocity of warp 9.975, and 15 decks. Some of the traditional circuitry has been replaced with bio-neural gel packs that contain synthetic neural cells, speeding up response time by organizing information more efficiently. The prototype, the U.S.S. Intrepid, was the third starship to bear the name.
