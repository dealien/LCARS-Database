SHIPS: Wysanti vessel

Craft used by a species targeted by the Borg. One such craft was used as bait to get the Borg’s attention. The Borg assimilated the craft and the plagued citizens aboard the craft. The plague spread through the local Collective unit and killed the crew of the craft. Juvenile members survived and were rescued by the U.S.S. Voyager.
Another Wysanti craft was encountered by the U.S.S. Voyager where they found a new Wysanti settlement and returned the rescued children to their people.
