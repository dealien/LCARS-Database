CLASS: Noggra
TYPE: freighter

These are a type of vessel that the Klingon government created and marketed to other governments, as well as its own, in an attempt to increase it economy following the Praxis catastophe.
A vessel that was two light-years from the Demilitarized Zone in 2370 when it detected the warp signature of the Maquis ship with the kidnapped Dukat aboard.
Another one departed into the wormhole after the preliminary Paqu-Novat talks on Deep Space Nine in 2369, giving Jake and Nog a chance to give Varis her first look at the anomaly.
Bo'Rak's feighter returning to the Klingon Empire suffered major computer damage and put in for repairs at Deep Space Nine for two days while Romulans visited in 2371. 

Reference: The Maquis
The Praxis information is conjectural to explain why numerous races use the same designed freighters. Possibly named after the House of Noggra, an allied House to that of Mogh, even though Noggra was introduced to the series later than the introduction of this class.
