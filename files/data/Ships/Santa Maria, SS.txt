A civilian colony ship en route to Gemulon V suffered life support system trouble and was stranded on an Orellious Minor planet, becoming its colonists' main shelter - dubbed "the cabin" - with cubicles devoted to individuals' rooms and a herb-filled medical area as well. It was stripped of all non-working technology so as not to remind the survivors of their past lives.
