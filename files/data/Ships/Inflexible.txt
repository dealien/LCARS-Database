SHIPS: Inflexible
TYPE: naval

A "full-rigger" ship in the British Royal Navy's fleet at the battle with the United States Continental Navy (including the Sloop-of-war Enterprise) at Valcour Island in October, 1776.  She was said to have had sixteen to eighteen "twelve-pounders" (cannons).  By comparison, the Continental Navy's gunboats only had twelve each.  During the battle, the Inflexible was unable to enter Valcour Bay until dusk due to strong winds.
