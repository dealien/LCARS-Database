A Kressari freighter, ostensibly carrying sensitive herbaceous DNA materials, due at Deep Space Nine some 36 hours after Quark and Constable Odo realized its homeworld is an arms go-between for Cardassia and an unwitting Bajoran terrorist group, The Circle; it was due back 1-1/2 days later. Its Captain Zef'no was enraged after a six-hour delay secretly used to check it out.
