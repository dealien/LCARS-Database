SHIPS: Essex, U.S.S.
CLASS: Daedalus
REGISTRY: NCC-173

Commanded by Captain Bryce Shumar, this craft was assigned to work in Admiral Uttan Narsu's sector of space, near Starbase 12. The ship was reported lost in 2167. In fact it was caught in an electromagnetic storm in the atmosphere of a class-M moon of planet Mab-Bu VI.
A group of condemned spirits claimed to be crew members from this ship in 2368. The criminal spirits took over the bodies of Deanna Troi, Data and Miles O'Brien in an attempt to escape their imprisonment in a penal colony. In reality, the crew of the Essex, including Captain Bryce Shumar, all perished when their ship was destroyed in the storm caused by the condemned spirits. The criminals were non-corporeal Ux-Mal fugitives.
