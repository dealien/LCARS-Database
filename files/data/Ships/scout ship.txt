SHIPS: Scout ships

Usually small, lightly armed starships with extensive sensor arrays, computer processing, and often with special features depending upon species; like cloaking on Klingon and Romulan craft. Some species have called these ships Bird-of-prey which causes some confusion with light cruisers.
