STATIONS: Cloud city
TYPE: atmospheric suspension

These space stations were built by the Stratosian people for use in nebula fields that they set up colonies within. Based on Fetlik Stardome designs, they are equipped with large domed greenlands on top of several decks of station that often includes ore processing facilities. Most Stratosian facilities include the ore handling systems to collect materials from local environments for the maintenance and repair of the city as well as for further building and expansion of the colony with more stations in the area and others.
These stations feature large hangar bays capable of accepting different size craft. Most of the bays are able to receive shuttles and other small transports. Dedicated round bays are reserved for the transfer of personnel carried on old Class-4 hulls. Large bays are also available that can encompass MK-X size starships and smaller, commonly used by the Stratosians after they were retired from service by the Starfleet over one hundred years ago.
