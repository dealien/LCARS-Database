FLEET: Kazon vessels

The many different Kazon fleets covered a vast portion of the Delta Quadrant. Many of their ships were of stolen Trabe design, a direct result of the Kazon overthrowing the Trabe in 2356. 
The ships were equipped with warp drive, powerful directed energy weapons, and torpedoes and launchers, but none of their weaponry was a match for Federation starships; however groups of them were more than a match for the Intrepid-class light cruiser displaced into the Delta Quadrant. These ships were not equipped with transporter systems so large capital ships had to rely on shuttlecraft in order to transfer crew to a planet. The small scout ships were able to enter planetary atmosphere and land on surfaces. These ships did not have replicators and so their crews actively sought this new technology since they are often looked upon as a lower-class species.

Classifications of ships operated by the Kazon include: 
Predator-class heavy cruisers
-class light cruisers
-class scouts
