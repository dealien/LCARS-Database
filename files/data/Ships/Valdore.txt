SHIPS: Valdore
CLASS:
TYPE: heavy cruiser

The Valdore is a newer, sleeker design of warbird, distinguished from its predecessor by its expansive wingspan and elongated hull. 
Under the command of Commander Donatra, the ship lead the Romulan campaign to stop Reman Shinzon and his massive warship, the Scimitar, from attacking Earth with its thalaron-radiation weapon. 
Donatra also aided Picard and the Enterprise-E in their efforts to stop Shinzon. This brief alliance marked a significant turn in Romulan-Federation relations.
During the incursion, the Valdore was severely damaged; left adrift, but salvageable.
