SHIPS: Bolian 
TYPE: freighter

A cargo ship under registry to the bald, bluish-skinned Federation race could not dock at a Deep Space Nine upper pylon on stardate 47552 and had to be towed to a lower mooring port - at least in the tale Commander Sisko told the replicant O'Brien.
Another was due in while Commander Sisko's party was held by the Jem'Hadar in the Gamma Quadrant.
About two weeks before stardate 47944, another freighter carrying photon launchers near the Demilitarized Zone was disabled by a Maquis ship and its cargo was stolen.
