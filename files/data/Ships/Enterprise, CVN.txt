SHIPS: Enterprise, U.S.S.
TYPE: naval aircraft carrier
REGISTRY: CVN-65

Twentieth century U.S. Naval warship whose dock was stationed at the Alameda Naval Base, across the bay from San Francisco. 
In 1986 Commander Pavel Chekov and Commander Nyota Uhura of the future took high-energy photons from this nuclear-powered vessel in order to recrystallize the dilithium on their Klingon Bird-of-Prey, the H.M.S. Bounty, and safely return to the 23rd century with the humpback whales George and Gracie. Chekov was detained by Naval officers of that ship, but managed to escape. 

Reference: The Voyage Home 
The aircraft carrier U.S.S. Ranger actually stood in for the Enterprise for filming during The Voyage Home since the real Enterprise was at sea at the time.
