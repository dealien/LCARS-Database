SHIPS: con artist’s ship

A crew of Delta Quadrant thieves have impersonated the crew of the U.S.S. Voyager and are using the reputation of the Federation starship to con gullible aliens into bad trade deals. Dala impersonates Captain Janeway, and Mobar mimicks Commander Tuvok in negotiations with the Telsian miners, clerics, and others in their space. Each time they are questioned about the unimpressive appearance of their craft, they claim it to be an old shuttle, but not out of contact with the powerful mothership, Voyager.
