SHIPS: future Klingon warship

This vessel appears to be a variant of the Negh'Var-class. In an alternate timeline, influenced by Q and created via a temporal anomaly, this future design of Klingon vessel attacked the U.S.S. Pasteur after that ship entered the Neutral Zone. 
The future Enterprise-D came to the Pasteur's aid, quickly dispensing with the Klingon threat.
