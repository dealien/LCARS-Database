SHIPS: Son'a warships
TYPE: heavy cruiser

These warships are the primary warp-driven ships used by the Son'a. 
Considerable resources within the ships were used for Son'a body-enhancement facilities. In 2375, these ships confronted the Enterprise-E at both the Ba'ku planet and inside the Briar Patch. 
The vessels are armed with isolytic-subspace weapons, which were outlawed by the Second Khitomer Accord.
