SHUTTLECRAFT: Kobali

A vessel used by the Kobali citizens of the Delta Quadrant. 
Lieutenant Lyndsay Ballard of the U.S.S. Voyager was revived and altered into a Kobali after her Terran corpse was jettisoned into space. The former officer used a shuttle to catch up with Voyager in an attempt to return to her former life. She returned to the Kobali civilization after the local authorities attacked the Federation starship while reclaiming her.
