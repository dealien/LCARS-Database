FLEET: Antedean vessels

A fleet of durable hulled ships that are capable of interstellat flight as well as underwater travel. These vessels have also been very useful in dense nebulas. Designed to simulate large fish, the Antedeans built their craft with fins and rounded hulls for movements through dense environments.
Each vessel is a rounded hull, usually in a teardrop shape. The craft are accented with teardrop shaped fins and modules. The bridge section is contained in a module added to the dorsal section of every ship. Running along each side of every class are the warp nacelles, set into the siding. Reinforced hull plating prevents warp field plasma from penetrating the hull into the living areas, and the same reflective materials helps to direct the warp field out and around the ship. By placing the nacelles into the ship's siding makes them less suceptible to damage in dense environments.

Classifications of ships built by the Antedeans include: 
Sharkelon-class light cruisers
Wallaby-class transports
Rassel-class freighters
Baraconda-class transports
Ramosa-class shuttles

These ships are are all conjectural.
