The Gr'oth was a replica of the original Klingon battle cruiser model designed by Matt Jefferies for the original Star Trek series. Modelmaker Greg Jein, who built the Gr'oth, changed Jeffereies design slightly by incorporating surface panel detailing similar to that done for the Klingon ships in The Motion Picture. Ironically, Koloth's ship was not seen in the The Trouble With Tribbles because the ship model had not yet been designed at that point in the original series.
