SHUTTLECRAFT: Captain`s yacht

Apparently a newer Starfleet tradition, this ship is a large elliptical shuttle vehicle on starships which remains docked at the very bottom of the ship's Saucer Module. It is intended for diplomatic missions, for dignitaries, ambassadors and other such missions. 
The one aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise NCC 1701-D was named Calypso, in honor of a 20th century Earth exploration vessel commanded Captain Jaques-Yves Cousteau. 
During a mission to the Ba'ku homeworld, Captain Picard, commanding the Enterprise-E, used a new design of the yacht, named the Cousteau, to defend the Ba'ku against the malicious Son'a.

Reference: Encounter at Farpoint, Insurrection
The name issued to the Enterprise starships are conjectural based on the word of Patrick Steward, who plays the captain of the starship in question.
