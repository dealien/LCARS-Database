SHIPS: D'kyr

Vulcan Starship that the Enterprise NX 01 was supposed to rendezvous with when its mission was cancelled in March 2152. Sub-Commander T’Pol and Doctor Phlox were to be dropped off on the D'kyr for transport home.  When Enterprise failed to make the rendezvous, the D'kyr monitored the encounter between Enterprise and several Suliban cell-ships.  After escaping the Helix, Enterprise managed to make the rendezvous, and convinced the Starfleet Command Council to allow Enterprise's mission to continue.
