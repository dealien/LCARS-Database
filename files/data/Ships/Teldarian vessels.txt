FLEET: Teldarian vessels

A group of craft used by the Teldarian government.
The Romulans likely planted a story in the mind of Commander Geordi La Forge to conceal his kidnapping and brainwashing that involved using a Teldarian ship giving La Forge a ride so he can catch up with the U.S.S. Enterprise-D at Krios after his Risa trip.
