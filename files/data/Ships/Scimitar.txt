SHIPS: Scimitar
TYPE: dreadnought

The Scimitar, a product of Reman engineering, served as both Shinzon's warship and as a massive, thaleron-radiation-based weapon. 
The vessel combines the clean lines of the traditional Romulan warbird with unique weaponry and styling. It is nearly twice as large as the Enterprise-E and can fire weapons while cloaked.
Armed with 52 disruptor banks, 27 photon torpedo bays, and equipped with primary and secondary phased shields, Scimitar is a formidable predator. 
Along with a massive weapons array, the ship can "transform" itself into a thalaron weapon, a weapon that uses thalaron radiation to wipe out life on the genetic level. Shinzon planned to take the Scimitar to Sector 001 and use the weapon to wipe out Earth, until Picard and the Enterprise-E intervened.
Before the vessel was destroyed, it managed to survive both a head-on collision with Enterprise and the subsequent sheering away from the starship.
