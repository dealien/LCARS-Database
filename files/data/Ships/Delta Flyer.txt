SHUTTLECRAFT: Delta Flyer
REGISTRY: NCC-74656-

A unique, technologically advanced shuttlecraft designed to withstand the atmosphere of a gas giant. Conceived by Tom Paris as a 24th-Century "hot rod," the Delta Flyer's design and construction was a collaborative effort among Voyager crew members, and represents their diverse backgrounds. It features ultra-aerodynamic contours, retractable nacelles, parametallic hull plating, a tetraburnium alloy hull, unimatrix shielding, and Borg-inspired weapons systems including photonic missiles. Duranium construction in its hull makes the craft especially robust under extreme conditions. Paris gave the high-tech machine an old-fashioned touch by incorporating ancient control levers and meters inspired by his "Captain Proton" holodeck program. 
The Delta Flyer's first mission was to retrieve an advanced multispatial probe from within a gas giant before it could be captured by the Malon. The Flyer was a crucial extension of the U.S.S. Voyager's capabilities for almost two years, until it was destroyed in late 2376 during an assault upon a Borg cube. 
The Delta Flyer was rebuilt in early 2377, and the new vessel was put to the test very quickly by being entered in the Antarian Trans-stellar Rally. The Flyer did not win the race, which turned out to be fortunate, since the vessel was sabotaged to explode at the finish line. Once the sabotage was discovered, the warp core was ejected in a nebula to contain the explosion, and the ship survived the incident. Before the Flyer could be refitted with a new warp core, however, the ship provided a "romantic getaway" for newlyweds Tom Paris and B'Elanna Torres.
