SHIPS: Klingon freighters

A variety of different ships used to move cargo about the Empire and their sphere of influence.
Noggra-class
These are a type of vessel that the Klingon government created and marketed to other governments, as well as its own, in an attempt to increase it economy following the Praxis catastophe.
A vessel that was two light-years from the Demilitarized Zone in 2370 when it detected the warp signature of the Maquis ship with the kidnapped Dukat aboard.
Another one departed into the wormhole after the preliminary Paqu-Novat talks on Deep Space Nine in 2369, giving Jake and Nog a chance to give Varis her first look at the anomaly.
Bo'Rak's feighter returning to the Klingon Empire suffered major computer damage and put in for repairs at Deep Space Nine for two days while Romulans visited in 2371.

The Praxis information is conjectural to explain why numerous races use the same designed freighters.
