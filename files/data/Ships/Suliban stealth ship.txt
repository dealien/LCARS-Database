SHIPS: stealth ship

This Suliban vessel has cloaking abilities. Members of the Cabal used a stealth cruiser to secretly destroy the Paraagan colony, making it appear as if the Enterprise NX-01's shuttle was responsible. 
With schematics provided by the mysterious operative known as Daniels, the Enterprise crew managed to find the cruiser, disable it, and steal its data disks.
