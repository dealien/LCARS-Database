CLASS: Incursion
TYPE: scout

A rare testbed project of Starfleet's with a ship that is able to mimick the look and sensor readings of other vessels with the use of a new holoprojector technology. This allows the ship to cross enemy lines and scout around without being attacked. When Starfleet and the Borg entered Fluidic space in an attempt to stop the Rift Maker, the U.S.S. Incursion was sent into Species 8472 territory to operate undetected.
