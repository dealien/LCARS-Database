SHIPS: Akritirian freighter

A vessel used by citizens in the Delta-Quadrant to transport small goods. The ship has an ion-based propulsion system that uses paralithium as fuel. They are small enough to fit inside a standard shuttlebay.
The U.S.S. Voyager encountered one of these ships in 2373 owned by Vel and Piri when a terrorist group, the Open Sky, created a bomb on board their ship and used it to destroy the Laktivia Recreational Facility on their world.
