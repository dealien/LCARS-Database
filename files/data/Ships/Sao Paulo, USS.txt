SHIPS: Sao Paulo, U.S.S.
CLASS: Defiant
TYPE: destroyer
REGISTRY: NCC-75633

"Give me liberty, or give me death" Patrick Henry
This ship was assigned to Deep Space Nine following the destruction of the U.S.S. Defiant. Admiral Ross allowed for special dispensation and changed the name of this ship to U.S.S. Defiant and transferred the Defiant crew to this ship. He also changed the ship’s registry to NX-74205 like the original.

Commissioned: 52859.3

Reference:
Named for the people of Brazil, as stated on the dedication plaque. The name change was done (no question about it) so that the visual effect department would not have to create new visuals for the remaining episodes of the series- they could continue to use stock footage of the Defiant.
