SHIPS: Gomtuu
Living ship

A very old, organic space-born life-form code named Tin Man by Starfleet Intelligence. It was apparently the very last of a species of spacecraft which lived in symbiosis with the crew who flew it - communicating with them telepathically. The crew aboard Gomtuu had been killed due to the radiation from an explosion which penetrated Gomtuu's skin, and since, Gomtuu has felt the loss deeply. Being a life-form with a social nature, the absence of Gomtuu's crew had made it terribly lonely, and it had wandered aimlessly for centuries, finally coming to Beta Stromgren before the star went nova to end its life. Betazoid and First Contact specialist, Tam Elbrun, communicated with Gomtuu and discovered a kindred soul. The two became fast friends, deeply intertwined, and eventually, Tam decided to stay aboard Gomtuu for the remainder of his own life. 
Tam Elbrun and Gomtuu did meet up with more of his own kind, but Tam was unable to translate the location since he was not trained in navigation. Gomtuu returned to this area of space when Tam also became ill from a virus picked up from a food source. The craft was escorted to Betazed while Tam was hospitalized. During this time Starfleet collected a team of officers to crew the ship and equip it with scientific equipment that would record mission records and navigation. When Tam was released from the hospital he accepted the help of the unique crew which consisted of hard to read telepathically species like Ferengi, Dopterian, and Vulcans. Lieutenant Nog was assigned to Gomtuu.
