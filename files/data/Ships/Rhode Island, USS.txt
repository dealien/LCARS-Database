SHIPS: Rhode Island, U.S.S.
-class
NCC-

Federation starship of late 24th-century design. In an alternate timeline (where the U.S.S. Voyager was lost for 23 years, rather than seven), Ensign Harry Kim was eventually promoted to captain and given command of the U.S.S. Rhode Island. Among the missions he commanded was a four-year deep space assignment, which took place starting about 2400. In 2404, Captain Kim took the Rhode Island to intercept Admiral Kathryn Janeway and avert her attempt to change history, without informing Starfleet and while telling his crew that he needed to take Janeway back to Starfleet Medical because she had contracted a rare disease known to affect judgment. Rather than stopping her, though, Kim allowed Janeway to convince him to help her see through her plan to use a chrono-deflector to make a one-way trip back in time. The Rhode Island even aided in Janeway's struggle against a pair of Klingon Negh’Var-class warships that attempted to destroy her shuttle.
