SHIP CLASS: Oberth
TYPE: Frigate

This kind of Federation starship is often used for scientific missions. The U.S.S. Grissom was of the Oberth-class. While in orbit of the Genesis Planet, Grissom was destroyed by Commander Kruge.
At the Battle of Wolf 359, an Oberth-class starship, in the Saratoga's battle group, was destroyed by the Borg. While trying to rescue his son, Sisko could see the ship's destruction through the portals of his quarters.
The class was named for 20th century German rocket pioneer Hermann Oberth.
