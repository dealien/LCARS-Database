SHIPS: New York
TYPE: naval

A gunboat in the United States Continental Navy in October, 1776. The fleet was under the command of General Benedict Arnold, and consisted of three schooners, four galleys, eight fifty-four foot gondalas, and a sloop-of-war (the Enterprise), sixteen ships in all.  On October 11, along with the rest of the fleet, the New York clashed with the British Royal Navy at Valcour Island.  The battle raged from noon until sunset.  The battle's toll on the New York was devastating, killing all of her officers save for her captain by the night's end.  The fleet escaped that night by retreating under the cover of a heavy fog which blanketed the bay.  History shows that the British fleet later caught up with them, however, forcing a second bloody confrontation.  Many ships were lost, but the New York (as well as the Enterprise and two other ships) survived to reach Fort Ticonderoga.  {Historical accounts show that the New York (as well as fellow gondalas Providence and Jersey) was scuttled at Schuyler Island on October
