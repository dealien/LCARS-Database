SHIPS: Bajoran
TYPE: transport

Bajoran transport ships make routine stops at Deep Space Nine, possibly as often as daily. They carry Bajoran civilians, government officials, Vedeks, and even the Kai, occasionally. 
For Jake Sisko and Nog, the Bajoran transports were a popular attraction — the boys enjoyed watching the Bajoran girls among those disembarking at Airlock 3.
Vedek Bareil was injured on a Bajoran transport en route to Deep Space Nine, when a micro-fracture ruptured in one of its warp plasma conduits and the entire relay system exploded. Kai Winn was also on board. The radiation leak from a loose plasma coil prevented transporter beam-off.
