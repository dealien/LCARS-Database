TYPE: interceptor

A type of large fighter with of crew of at least ten. These ships are small enough to be able to be stored aboard starships and space stations, but large enough to be assigned to missions away from the home port.
Maquis forces were very fond of acquiring ships that could be converted into this kind of vessel since fighters were not effective enough against capital ships, nor could they be effective over a distance necessary to get from their base to any Cardassian targets.
