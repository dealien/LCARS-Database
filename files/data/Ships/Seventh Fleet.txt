SHIPS: Seventh Fleet

A large tactical group of starships assigned to protect the Federation from invading armadas. This group of Federation starships was assembled to fight in the Dominion War. It was led by Captain Bennet. 
This Starfleet task force sustained heavy losses and was nearly crippled at least twice - once while fighting Dominion forces at the Tyra system, and again while protecting Vulcan. The Seventh Fleet went to Kalandra in 2375 to launch a new offensive.

The Continuum made two separate entries but I merged them together. There is no reason to assume that Starfleet has two “Seventh Fleets” even though one was called the Seventh Tactical Wing.
