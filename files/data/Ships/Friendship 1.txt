PROBE: Friendship One

A probe launched from Earth in 2067 with a message of peace to other worlds. Contact was lost with the probe while it was en route to the Delta Quadrant. 
Years later the probe make contact with a civilization that attempts to duplicate the matter/ antimatter reaction process as seen on the probe. There efforts were a failure and the planet suffered radiation poisoning as a result. The population speculated that the probe may have truly been sent to the planet for that explicit purpose, to weaken its enemy in preparation for an invasion.
The U.S.S. Voyager did find the probe after being lost for 130 years, and the planet with 5500 citizens on it. The Voyager used torpedoes to begin an isolitic chain reaction within the planet’s atmosphere which cleared up the dark radiation cloud that encompassed their world for decades.
