Its name honored geoscientist Farouk El-Baz, a NASA planetary scientist and Brown University faculty member in the late 20th century. This craft was deisggned by Rick Sternbach and Richard McKenzie under the direction of production designer Richard James, miliature built by Tony Meininger. The El-Baz was the first shuttle of this type seen; subsequent shuttlepods were re-dresses of the El-Baz. The shuttlepod was smaller than the shuttlecraft, and was used because it was impractical at the time to build a full exterior of the larger shuttlecraft.
