CLASS: Messier
TYPE: cruiser

The last exclusively Earth-built major series, these ships were the first to have integrated Earth-alien crews. They were originally commissioned in 2078 and typically served until 2110. These ships were refitted for military use, and the Pollux, for example, saw considerable action during the Romulan War.
This was the first starship created that was designed to accommodate extraterrestrial lifeforms.
