SHIPS: Revenge
TYPE: Navel

A schooner in the United States Continental Navy in October, 1776.  The fleet was under the command of General Benedict Arnold, and consisted of three schooners, four galleys, eight fifty-four foot gondalas, and a sloop-of-war (the Enterprise), sixteen ships in all.  On October 11, along with the rest of the fleet, clashed with the British Royal Navy at Valcour Island.  The Continental Navy fought valiantly, but late that evening found themselves in a perilous position.  Unable to fight the British fleet further, the Continental fleet chose to flee under the cover of a heavy fog which flowed into the bay late that evening.   {Although they were successful in escaping that night, history shows that the British Navy later caught up with them, forcing a second bloody confrontation.  Many ships were lost, but the Revenge (along with the Enterprise and two other Continental ships) survived to reach Fort Ticonderoga.}
