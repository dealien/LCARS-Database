CLASS: Shadow
TYPE: medium cruiser

The Tal Shiar, having need of a vessel more suited for their covert operations, assembled the gretest military scientists in the Star Empire. The culmination of their efforts resulted in the Shadow-class. The technology on board the Shadow is extremely classified, so much so that even members of the Romulan Senate are not "officially" aware of its existence. The Shadow comes equipped with disruptors, but cal also be refitted with four experimental technologies: holo-emitters, osychonic blast, energy shield converters, and phase cloaking. These vessels do not have the ability to perform a traditional cloak if the special phase cloak were to fail.
