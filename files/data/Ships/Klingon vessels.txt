FLEET: Klingon vessels

An assortment of armed spaceships used by the Klingon Empire to secure its borders. This race of beings has very few civilian craft since its culture is heavily focused on glory during battle, and since its economy also heavily supports its military budget. Very few Klingons become medical or scientific personnel.
The Klingons have not had speedy changes in their starship designs over the years like the Federation has. Since many Klingons do not become engineers either, not much has been done in the way of advancing their technology. However, Klingon technology is comparable to current Federation standards in most tactical areas; and Klingons were the first race to develop photon torpedos. During a brief period in the 2260s the Klingons developed a technology treaty with the Romulans where the warriors offered better warp drive and ship designs in return for the cloaking ability from the stealthy neighbors.
