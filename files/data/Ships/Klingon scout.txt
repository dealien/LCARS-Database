SHIPS: Klingon scout ship

An otherwise undescribed ship and its crew who had kept Odo on guard leaves DS9 without incident just as Q appears. It was small enough to moor at Docking Bay 11. 
The Klingon Defense Force uses several different types of ships for scouting purposes:
B’rel-class
Nuq’Duj-class
