CLASS: Toros
TYPE: fighter
Also known as a Bajoran raider or Bajoran impulse fighter

Dated sub-impulse attack craft of Bajoran service, used in later years by the Occupation fighters. Two can barely be seated in the cramped cockpit, accessible through a side hatch. Propulsion is thruster technology only; the engine is accessed through a rear cockpit panel, and includes an ejectable plasma tank which fuels the thrusters; plasma conduits are located aft. It carried a proximity sensor system due to its small size, as well as navigational sensors, phaser-sight locks, and a small manual fire extinguisher under the rear seat. Dax and Kira used one that barely flew to ferry news of Cardassian involvement with The Circle to the Chamber of Ministers in 2370.
