STATIONS: Helix

A massive Suliban mothership operated by the Kabol. The Helix is usually accompanied by the smaller, Suliban cell ships. These smaller ships can connect via magnetic latching that make the overall ship larger. In 2151, Captain Archer and Trip Tucker infiltrated the Helix and freed the Klingon, Klaang. Archer also discovered the mysterious Temporal Chamber.
