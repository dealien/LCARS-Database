SHIPS: Yorktown, U.S.S.
CLASS: Zodiac
REGISTRY: NCC-61137

The third starship to bear the name. During the anti-time reality created by the Q Continuum on stardate 47988.1, the Yorktown received orders from Admiral William Riker to make long-range sensor sweeps of the Devron system searching for of a temporal anomaly. 

Reference: All Good Things...
This ship is considered to be a different type than the second since the registry number indicates it is unlikely that Tuvok's father served aboard such a new ship, and it was established that his father served on the 2nd Yorktown.
