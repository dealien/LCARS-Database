STATIONS: Orpheus mining post

The mining colony of Orpheus, located on Earth's moon, was actually a massive ship, used by Paxton, the leader of Terra Prime. 
This vessel allowed Paxton to wield Prime's stance against human-alien alliances. The majority of the mining colony constituted the vessel, which was capable of warp.
Paxton used the ship to leave the moon, en route to Mars' verteron array. There, the ship linked with the array and used it to gouge a crater into Earth's moon.
The ship has landing struts that allow for all-terrain landings and take-offs.
