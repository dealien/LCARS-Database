SHIPS: Romulan science vessel

A variant of the Talon-class scout ship, this was basically a weaponless version of the military vessel.
In 2368, a scout ship was used to test an experimental, interphase, generator-based cloaking device. The ship's warp core malfunctioned during the test, but the Enterprise-D helped it return to Romulan space. 
The Talvath was a Romulan science ship, captained in 2351 by Telek. The ship picked up the U.S.S. Voyager's communication through a micro-wormhole that distorted time and distance. Voyager's message was sent into the past.
