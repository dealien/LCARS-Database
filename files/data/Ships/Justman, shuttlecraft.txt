Its name honors late 20th century television producer and futurist Robert H. Justman, a veteran of both the original Star Trek and The Next Generation. The full-sized shuttlecraft filmed on stage was labeled Justman (Type 6), although a different shuttle design was seen in the visual effects scenes of a miniature shuttle in flight (Type 7).
