SHIPS: Jaheel`s vessel
TYPE: freighter

A small, wedge-shaped warp-drive cargo ship of unknown registry destroyed when its aphasia-panicked Captain Jaheel tried to pull away from Deep Space Nine with the mooring clamps still locked on stardate 46423.7. Initially needing its anti-matter flow converter re-adjusted and carrying a load of perishable "Tamen Sasheer" due for Largo V, it had been delayed for over two days on Deep Space Nine.
