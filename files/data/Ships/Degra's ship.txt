SHIPS: Degra's vessel

A Xindi primate vessel in use by the scientist/leader Degra. This sleek, Xindi vessel played a crucial role in forging a peace between certain Xindi factions and Archer of Enterprise. 
Degra, a Xindi-Primate, used his ship to destroy a fellow Xindi vessel, an act that a Xindi-Reptillian Commander did not let go unpunished.
Archer used Degra's ship in an effort to catch up with the Xindi weapon before it reached Earth.
