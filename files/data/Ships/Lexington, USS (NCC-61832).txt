The third starship to bear the name. For the graduating class of 2369 this ship was the prime request for a posting for its exploration mission into uncharted territory. It docked at Deep Space Nine in 2371, giving Chief Medical Officer Elizabeth Lense, from the class of '69, a chance to visit with her former classmate, Dr. Julian Bashir. Lense was a little disappointed with her choice after serving two years. The hectic pace of exploration never gave her a chance to properly study anthing, unlike what she expected her job to be like.
