SHUTTLECRAFT: Shuttle Plane

This very large shuttleplane was designed for use with Stellarford-class star-liners. Excellent life-support systems and multi-redundant automatic distress signaling made this a sought-after interplanetary craft in its own right. With its 65 passenger capacity, the Shuttleplane proved to be a perfect life rescue ship for interstellar travel.
