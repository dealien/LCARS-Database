CLASS: Galileo
TYPE: transport

One of the most durable workhorses in Terran spaceflight history, the Galileo-class ships were extremely durable and long-lasting vessels. These early fusion ships could attain modest relativistic speeds (.2c, later .35c) and traveled to the outer planets and beyond into interstellar space. In the 2030’s the Galileo was the primary ship class to the Asteroid Belt, and in the 2040’s the most popular carrier to the outer planets.
