CLASS: Aventuer
TYPE: science

This was the first ship whose final assembly was completed entirely in Earth orbit. Advanced fission propulsion and capacious cargo modules made this an invaluable vessel for early planetary flight, and in fact the U.N.S.S. Lewis and Clark was the first manned ship to Jupiter. Under the command of Colonel Shaun Christopher, later Chief of Staff of UNSF, it took part in the historic Earth-Saturn probe of 2020. These classification of ships typically traveled between Earth and Mars (5.5 days), Earth and Jupiter (39.5 days), and Earth and Saturn (81 days).
