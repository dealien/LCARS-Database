CLASS: O'Kan
TYPE: transport

A Starfleet-Vulcan hybrid designed vessel serving in the Vulcan fleet. It was based on the Oberth-class vessel and has many of the same dimensions.
The main hull is a large square containing the cargo holds and the shuttle hangars in the aft. The aft and bow are rounded off so the hull is not a perfect square. On top of that is the command section, a round saucer with its center positioned over the front edge of the lower decks. In the command section is the bridge, crew facilities, and passenger accommodations.
The engineering hull is much like the trough of a boat and is connected to the main hull by two support arms that are equipped with the ship's impulse drive engines. This hull contains the fuel tanks, matter/ anti-matter reaction chamber, and some additional cargo storage, usually filled with ship's needs.
