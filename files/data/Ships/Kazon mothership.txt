CLASS: Predator
TYPE: carrier

Huge Trabe mothership vessel used by the Trabe and various Kazon sects, equipped with a tractor beam and apparently employing ion propulsion, judging by the detectable ion trail left in its wake. This huge Kazon vessel dwarfs Voyager in size. Culluh's Carrier-type vessel has a tow emitter and is armed with photonic charges. As with all Kazon tactics, their ships are used as raiders to plunder their prey.
One was destroyed by Chakotay's kamikaze use of his Maquis fighter. Another was used by the Nistrim during the successful attack on Voyager. In a malfunction-created holodeck delusion experienced by the holographic doctor aboard the U.S.S. Voyager, that crew came under attack by two Predator-class Kazon warships in 2372.
