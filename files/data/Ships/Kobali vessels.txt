FLEET: Kobali vessels

A design of cruisers and shuttles in use by the formerly deceased citizens within the Delta Quadrant. After the death of Lieutenant Lyndsay Ballard this race revived and altered her corpse to incorporate her into their race. When Ballard chased down the U.S.S. Voyager in an attempt to rejoin the crew she used a shuttle to catch up with the starship. Several cruisers chased on Ballard in an attempt to bring her back. They fired on Voyager until she relented and returned to her new family.
