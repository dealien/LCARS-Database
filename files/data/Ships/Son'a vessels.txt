FLEET: Son`a vessels

The primary warp-driven ships used by the Son'a. There are two different types of cruisers in use, a heavy cruiser, and a light one. Both use technology of comperable level to Federation sciences. These ships do include subspace weapons, despite the fact that all other races have agreed not to use such unpredictable devices. 
The ships are based on large sweeping circle-shaped hulls. Considerable resources within the ships were used for Son'a body enhancement facilities. In 2375, these ships confronted the U.S.S. Enterprise-E at the Ba'ku planet inside the Briar Patch.
A unique Son'a craft, the collector, has also been seen but it is believed to be one-of-a-kind and may never be seen again since the first unit was destroyed.
