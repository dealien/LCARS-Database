SHIPS: Congress
TYPE: Naval

A gunboat in the United States Continental Navy at the battle with the British Royal Navy at Valcour Island in October, 1776.  The ship carried the commander of the fleet, General Benedict Arnold.  The fleet consisted of three schooners, four galleys, eight fifty-four foot gondalas, and a sloop-of-war (the Enterprise), sixteen ships in all.  The Congress took serious damage during the battle.  Later that evening it was reported that she had "twelve holes in her" and that she was taking on water.  The Congress escaped late that night under the cover of fog along with the rest of the U.S. fleet.  
Historical accounts show, however, that the British fleet later caught up with them while trying to reach Fort Ticonderoga.  The Congress was destroyed by Arnold, rather than surrendering her to the British.  Arnold and his troops made it to land and later rejoined the remaining ships of the Continental fleet.
