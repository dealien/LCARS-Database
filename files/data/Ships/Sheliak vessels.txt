FLEET: Sheliak vessels

A Sheliak vessel encountered the Enterprise-D and demanded that the Federation evacuate all human "vermin" from the planet Tau Cygna V, a planet that belongs to the alien race, as stated in a Federation treaty. 
Picard negotiated with the captain of the vessel, using a clause in the treaty to buy more time to evacuate Tau Cygna V.

It looks like they may have modified the "Merchantman" model from "The Search for Spock" and added pontoons and other equipment to make this look different. This is purely speculative.
