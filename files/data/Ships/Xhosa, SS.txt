SHIPS: Xhosa, S.S.
CLASS: Antares

Kasidy Yates' freighter ("ZOE-sah") was accosted by Klingons patrolling Cardassia's sealed border prior to their invasion an hour out of Deep Space 9; its distress call was jammed after just getting through. The older-model ship features consoles from a century ago, and has a boxy bridge. Now under Bajoran registry, its crew includes a Bolian male engineer named Brathaw, and human and Markalian crewmen; all were dropped off at a Maquis base on Yates' return to face her punishment. Its cargo hold is capable of radiating its contents with a baryon sweep.

The exterior of the Xhosa was a re-use of the Batris, first seen in "Heart of Glory." The bridge interior, seen in "For the Cause," featured control panel and instrument designs that were closely based on the panels designed for the original starship Enterprise bridge.
