SHIPS: U.S.S. Crazy Horse
CLASS: Excelsior
TYPE: heavy cruiser
REGISTRY: NCC-50446

A Federation starship under the command of Captain Enzo Rudolfini. Commander Elizabeth Wu served on the Crazy Horse for many years, three of them as head of security, before being transferred onto the U.S.S. Stargazer. Other crewmembers were T'lar, Omalayak and Mecir.
The ship was assigned as a member of task force 3 under Captain Jean-Luc Picard's indirect command to respond to an anticipated Borg invasion circa 2369. The next year, the Galaxy-class U.S.S. Enterprise received orders to proceed to a rendezvous with the Crazy Horse on a mission to retrieve Admiral Erik Pressman to search for the U.S.S. Pegasus. The starship was named for one of the most important Indian leaders at the Battle of Little Bighorn in 1876, the Oglala Sioux chief.
