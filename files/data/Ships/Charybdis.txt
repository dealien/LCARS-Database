SHIPS: Charybdis

The third manned vessel to leave the Sol System, commanded by Colonel Stephen Richey. It was launched by NASA on July 23, 2037.
In 2365, it was discovered as debris in orbit around the planet of Theta 116. Apparently the ship suffered a telemetry failure and its fate was unknown until the Enterprise-D discovered it in orbit. 
Its captain was removed from the vessel and taken care for by unknown as advanced aliens. They constructed a bubble of atmosphere on the otherwise inhospitable planet and built "The Royale Hotel" and furnished Terran residents to occupy the building. These were all fashioned after the book that Richey had taken with him on his voyage.

In Greek mythology, Charybdis is one of the two sea monsters who lived in a cave near the Straits of Messina. The other monster was Scylia, mentioned in "Samaritan Snare."
