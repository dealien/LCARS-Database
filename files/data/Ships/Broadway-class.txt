The U.N.S.S. Hurok was the flagship of the U.E.S.P.A. Galactic Cultural Exchange Project. A hybrid ship, it was originally a Merchant-class cargo ship that was renovated to accommodate the specific needs of its complement of cultural ambassadors. Through the decades, the Hurok was refitted with the latest warp engines, and this incredibly sturdy classic can still be seen in operation at various ports of call.

Some references to the UFP were changed to the U.E.S.P.A. since canon sources have indicated that the Federation wasn’t founded until after the starship went into use.
