FLEET: Lokirrim vessels

Two craft were encountered by the crew of the U.S.S. Voyager while on their mission in the Delta Quadrant, a patrolship and a warship. These people were having a war with photonic beings, also known as holograms. This race detected the EMH in use aboard the Delta Flyer shuttle and captured and detained the ship trying to find the energy citizen.
