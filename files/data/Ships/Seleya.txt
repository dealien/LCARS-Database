Vulcan ship that journeyed into the Delphic Expanse. T'Pol served on this ship for over a year as Deputy Science Officer under Captain Voris - it was her last assignment before joining the Consulate on Earth. 
During their mission to the Expanse, Captain Archer and the crew of the Enterprise NX-01 discovered the Seleya floating in an asteroid field. Apparently, the Vulcans were attempting to line the ship with trellium-D when they suddenly deteriorated into violent, zombie-like creatures. Tests proved that trellium-D poisonous to the Vulcan nervous system.
