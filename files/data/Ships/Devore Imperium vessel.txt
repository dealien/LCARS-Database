SHIPS: Devore Imperium vessel

The Devore Imperium use their vast ships to "police" their space for "gaharay", or strangers. These gaharay are instantly suspect and therefore must undergo a thorough search and inspection of their vessel. 
A Devore ship, under the command of Kashyk, made a habit out of inspecting Voyager, if not harassing Captain Janeway.
Devore ships uses a scanning pulse array to track ships that pass through Devore space.
