CLASS: Mann
TYPE: cruiser

The Mann-class was employed primarily for strategic purposes, providing defense and security within the ever-growing colonized space. Using advanced third generation propulsion, these ships used pure matter/antimatter annihilation for powering their engines and ship’s systems. The Endurance supervised the largest spacelift in Federation history, where over ten million residents of Bayard’s Planet were successfully evacuated. This starship was the first to feature turbo-lift elevators.

Some references to the UFP were changed to the U.E.S.P.A. since canon sources have indicated that the Federation was founded after these ships were built.
