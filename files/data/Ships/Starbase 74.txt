STATIONS: Starbase 74

A massive Federation orbiting facility, at the planet Tarsas III, commanded by Commander Orfil Quinteros. 
In 2364, the U.S.S. Enterprise NCC-1701-D received an upgrade to its computer systems there. The operation was abruptly interrupted, however, when the Bynars responsible for the upgrade suddenly hijacked the Galaxy-class starship in a desperate effort to save their own dying homeworld.

This was obviously a re-use of the Spacedock model created for the films. Since the exact same doors used to launch the Constitution-class Enterprise were used to allow access to the Galaxy-class ship this station could be said to be F A R bigger than the Earth-orbiting station, but it is now assumed that Spacedock has been upgraded and enlarged.
