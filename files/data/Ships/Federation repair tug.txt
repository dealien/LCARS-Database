SHIPS: Federation repair tugs

A variety of ships used by the members of the United Federation of Planets for performing repairs of space-borne vessels and stations. These ships include engineering teams, workbees, repair supplies, and tractor beams to lock on and hold a target vessel at a relative distance to prevent impact when the two come close together. These ships often are equipped with tractor beams capable of towing a vessel to a shipyard but not always.
