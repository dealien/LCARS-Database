PROBE: V'Ger
Also known as Voyager VI

A sentient, massive entity which threatened Earth in 2271, en route to find its "Creator." In doing so, V'Ger destroyed anything it encountered by digitizing it for its memory chamber. 
Generating a power field "cloud" about itself of over 22 AUs in diameter, the entity had gained sentience after unknown aliens repaired the old Earth space probe that formed its core, Voyager 6, whose name in corrupted English gave the sentience its name. 
The entity, which viewed organic lifeforms as carbon-based units "infesting" starships, later joined with Starfleet's Lt. Ilia and Cmdr. Will Decker and evolved into a higher, yet unknown lifeform.
