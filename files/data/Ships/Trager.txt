SHIPS: Trager
CLASS: Galor

A Cardassian, Galor-class warship, the Trager had a crew of 600. 
On Stardate 44429.6, the Trager launched an assault on the Enterprise-D, in retaliation for what they claimed to be the U.S.S. Phoenix's unprovoked attack on a Cardassian science station. In attacking the Cardassian ship, the Phoenix violated the Cardassian-Federation peace treaty of 2366.
