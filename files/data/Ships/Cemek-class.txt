CLASS: Cemek
TYPE: transport

As with all Fetlik vessels, this ship begins with the typical saucer shape and proven warp core design with the centralized bridge and deflector dish.
These ships are clearly designed for atmospheric entry and landing since they are equipped with a set of landing skids. Built much smaller than the Geolu class transport, this freighter was originally built for heavy ore hauling. They were supposed to land on the asteroids, fill up, and haul the ores off to be processed.

These ships are conjectural.
