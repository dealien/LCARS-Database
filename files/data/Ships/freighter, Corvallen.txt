SHIPS: Corvallen freighter
CLASS: Antares

A Corvallen freighter-for-hire was part of a complicated plan to help Romulan Vice-Proconsul M'ret and his aides defect to the Federation. Subcommander N'Vek destroyed the freighter when it appeared that the captain of the ship was being deceitful about following through with the plan.
