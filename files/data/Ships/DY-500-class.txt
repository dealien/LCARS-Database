CLASS: DY-500
TYPE: cruiser

An early sub-light exploration craft in use by the United Nations of Earth space fleet. While the Aventeur-class was fulfilling its commissioned lifespan, the early DY-100 series underwent extensive design and performance upgrading to become the DY-500 series. It’s almost pure fission engine plant produced a clean gas exhaust, which in turn powered an advanced Magentohydrodynamic (MHD) generator for on-board electricity. This class was particularly popular for travel to and within the Asteroid Belt. The loss of a DY-500, the U.N.S.S. Courageous, was also the worst space tragedy in the first 65 years of spaceflight. Standard range for this craft was rated for 600 million kilometers, and a maximum of 1.15 billion kilometers.
