TYPE: shuttlepods

A very small vehicle for up to three humanoids, even smaller than the standard shuttlecraft, carried on board Federation starships, including the U.S.S. Enterprise NCC-1701-D. The craft, configured in at least three distinct types, are limited to sublight travel between fairly short interplanetary distances. Dr. Seyetik planed to use a two-seater Starfleet shuttlepod stationed aboard the ferrying Prometheus to control remotely the planting of protomatter in the near-dead Epsilon 119 star; even then, it carried a containment device to safeguard the pod. Sometime between stardate 47552.9 and 47569.4, Commander Sisko noted the loss of a DS9 shuttlepod. At least one shuttlepod was attached to the U.S.S. Defiant.

Shuttlepods were originally created since building a full size shuttle would have required more time, money, and supplies than the show's producers were able to allocate in the early episodes of the show.
