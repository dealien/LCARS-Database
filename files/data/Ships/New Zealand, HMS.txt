SHIPS: New Zealand, H.M.S.
CLASS: DY-500

Under the command of Captain Bob Lederman. This diplomatic transport made an expedition to the Ficus Sector.

Reference: Up the Long Ladder
The ship was read from a list taken off the Enterprise-D's monitor. The captain is actually one of the Star Trek production team members and was included in the list as one of the many jokes on the set. His mission actually read that he was en route to Alderaan, a reference to the destroyed world in "Star Wars IV: A New Hope."
