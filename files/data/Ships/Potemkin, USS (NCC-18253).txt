SHIPS: Potemkin, U.S.S.
CLASS: Excelsior
REGISTRY: NCC-18253

Second starship to bear the name.
In 2361, Lieutenant William Riker led an away team to Nervala IV, and was promoted and commended for "exceptional valor" on the mission. The weather on the planet made performing very difficult and transporting dangerous. It wasn't realized that this mission created a duplicate Riker during a transporter malfunction. 
This ship was also the last Federation starship to make contact with the failed Turkana IV colony prior to the mission made by the U.S.S. Enterprise-D in 2367. Potemkin personnel were warned by the planetary inhabitants that transport to the surface would not be safe and all trespassers would be killed.
The Potemkin rendezvoued with the Enterprise-D on 45587 to transfer Dr. Toby Russell to the larger ship.
William T. Riker served aboard this vessel prior to his assignment to the U.S.S. Hood and his position aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise-D, and after his posting on the U.S.S. Pegasus. While aboard he used the unconventional tactic of positioning the craft over a planet's magnetic pole, thus making the ship difficult to detect by an opponent's sensors.
