FLEET: Pralor vessels

Spacecraft built by a long dead civilization whose starships are being used by automated personnel units to fight a war against the Cravic. Larger than Voyager, the vessel of the surviving Delta Quadrant's robotic race has a subspace defense field impenetrable to Starfleet targeting scanners and other sensors - though the field can be penetrated at its weak points by matching shield harmonics.
