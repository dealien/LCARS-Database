SHIPS: Bajoran interceptor

A starship in the Mirror Universe, the Avenger was commanded by Admiral Black. 
The Defiant, under the command of the Mirror Universe's Jonathan Archer, came to the Avenger's aid during a rebel attack. The Avenger joined the Defiant at warp, soon after Admiral Black boarded Archer's starship from the future. 

After Archer killed Black with a hand phaser from the Defiant, the Avenger's crew joined the Defiant, with the Avenger presumably scuttled.

The Continuum said that these ships were seen in Emissary but I don't recall that- the site did not mention the name of the episode featuring the Skreeans.
