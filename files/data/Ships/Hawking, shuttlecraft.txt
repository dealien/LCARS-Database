Assigned to the U.S.S. Enterprise-D and stored in the main hangar bay of the saucer module.

Named for renowned Earth scientist Stephen Hawking, a 20th century mathematical physicist. He was actually on an episode of Star Trek The Next Generation when Data included him in his poker game of famous physicists. The shuttle used in the movie was a different type than that used in the TV episode. The name was re-used despite the technical error because of Executive Producer Rick Berman's admiration for the noted physicist.
