"THERE WILL BE AN ANSWER, LET IT BE"
Federation Starship. Mollie Katz had been assigned to the Phoenix some time before 2333.	
The starship went on a rampage against Cardassians near Sector 21503 in 2367. Captain Benjamin Maxwell suspected Cardassians of rearming despite a recent peace treaty - until he stood down under pressure for the Enterprise-D and turned the command over to his first officer while returning to Starbase 211 under arrest.

The Pheonix was the first appearance of a Nebula-class starship. The starship was presumably named after Zefram Cochrane's historic warp ship that first broke the light-speed barrier in 2063.
