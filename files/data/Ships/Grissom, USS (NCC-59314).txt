While I would often prefer to agree with entires from the encyclopedia instead of the website, since I personally have found the book to be accurate much more often, I chose to use the registry number as designated by Paramount's official source. Since the number was not seen nor mentioned in the show I feel that the website identifies Paramount's choice in the matter. I accept that it is still probably a mistake on behalf of the webmasters and may be changed in a revision of website data.
