CLASS: Defiant
TYPE: destroyer

An “escort” vessel developed by Starfleet at the Utopia Planitia Yards while Commander Sisko served there. It was one of the numerous efforts designed to repel a Borg invasion.
The prototype, the U.S.S. Defiant, was assigned to Deep Space Nine in an effort to provide additional strength in case the Jem’Hadar were to ever come through the wormhole and attempt to claim space in the Alpha Quadrant.
