CLASS: Cochrane
TYPE: cruiser

This vessel class was the first production style starship produced by Terrans with warp drive.  After more than a decade of design, construction and validation testing, the Bonaventure and its fellow classmates inaugurated a new era in spaceflight exploration. inaccessible interstellar spans became reasonable distances, as demonstrated by this ship’s journey in 2061 to Tau Ceti, nearly 12 light years away. On its third voyage, to Sirius, the Bonaventure was unaccountably lost.
These ships were notable for several other "firsts" a s well. They were the first craft to employ Warp Celestial Navigation which was an extra-terrestrial component;. the first to use an alien piece of equipment.
