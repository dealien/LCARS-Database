A tough, mid-20th century Terran American military ground vehicle, the name stemming from the acronym "Government Property," "GP." Odo assumed the form of one while accompanying the time-stranded Ferengis and their hosts in Roswell, New Mexico in 1947. Many of the machines were built at numerous plants across the North American continent until the wide use of hover cars took over. The break-up of General Motors, its parent company, left the single plant in Toledo, Ohio open for design and manufacturing. That plant is now a specialty facility for Starfleet parts.
