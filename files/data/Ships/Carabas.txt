SHIPS: Carabas
CLASS: Delta

Smuggling ship owned by Mohrlien & Tama. A Delta-class runner, The Carabas had a Federation hull, however the engines were modified extensively. The Carabas was powered with a Cardassian power plant salvaged during the Cardassian war. It  was a two-man craft which ran guns and software to Bajor during the Occupation.  Small, even for a merchant ship, the mainframe and aft corridor were barely wide enough to accomodate two people walking abreast.  The ship had a cramped control room, with twin control stations tucked forward under a main screen that followed the curve of the ship's nose.  Despite its small size, it was able to carry three times its working mass in cargo. Odo dealt with the Carabas from his first days on the station.  The Carabas came to Deep Space Nine in 2370 in order to smuggle parts for the pirate ship, Helios.  Unfortunately Mohrlien and Tama were arrested while making the rendezvous.  After helping retrieve two hostages from the Helios, Mohrlien and Tama escaped from the station aboard the Carabas.
