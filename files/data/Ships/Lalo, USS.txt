A Starfleet freighter that, while in the Pegos Minor area in 2364, reported a time-loop distortion as an echo of Paul Manheim's experiments on Vandor IX. Two years later it was the first starship to be destroyed by the Borg, some 3 hours, 12 minutes after leaving Zeta Alpha II en route to Sentinel Minor IV.
