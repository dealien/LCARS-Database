SHUTTLECRAFT: Argo
TYPE: 21
MODEL:
MISSION: 

The Argo shuttle is the latest and most advanced design of shuttlecraft thus far, a two vehicle pair.
The ship, equipped with retractable wings that allow the craft to easily land on a variety of planet surfaces, is housed in the Enterprise-E's main shuttlebay, located on the saucer section. The Argo allows away teams to achieve quick and easy ship-to-shore missions, where it would be too dangerous to beam only an away team. An ATV, under the same namesake as the shuttle which houses it, is a standard feature of the Argo. 
Both the shuttle and the ATV were tested in the field circa Stardate 56844. Captain Picard, Data and Worf used the craft to investigate unique positronic signatures on Kolarus III.
