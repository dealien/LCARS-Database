FLEET: Breen vessels

A group of ships that Starfleet has very limited information about since the Breen are mostly an elusive race, not having had any scirmishes with Federation forces until the Dominion War. But Starfleet Intelligence does believe that there is a connection between the ships used by the Breen and those used by the Son'a and the Miradorn, indicating a possible collaboration or possible treaties in the past between the races.

Classifications of ships built by the Breen include: 
Adenum-class light cruisers
Bulgari-class heavy cruisers
Crasaver-class medium cruisers
Ivantis-class scouts & shuttles
Tolandi-class transport-tugs
