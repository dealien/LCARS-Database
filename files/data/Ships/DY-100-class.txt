SHIP CLASS: DY-100
TYPE: transport

A late 20th century interplanetary vessel design built on Earth using nuclear powered engines and equipped with suspended-animation chambers for longer voyages during the pre-warp era, superceded by 2018 by designs with better sublight technology. Because these ships traveled at such slow speeds (relatively) the crew often entered suspended animation in order to endure the long travel times- hence the ships were often called "sleeper ships."

SHIPS OF THE LINE:
S.S. Botany Bay

Reference: Space Seed, Strangers from the Sky
A conjectural model of the Botany Bay, built by Greg Jein for a photograph in the Star Trek Chronology, was equipped with several space shuttle-style solid rocket strap-on boosters, suggesting how the 1996-vintage spacecraft might have gotten into orbit. The model was seen as a desktop decoration in Rain Robinson's SETI laboratory in the 1996 scenes of "Future's End."
