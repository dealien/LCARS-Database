SHIPS: Jem’Hadars
TYPE: fighter

Two designs observed by Starfleet Intelligence in use by the Jem'Hadar to patrol planets, starbases, and other property controlled by the Dominion. These ships were introduced to the Dominion War late in the event and did not play a significant part in that battle, but are more common in the distant Gamma Quadrant.
