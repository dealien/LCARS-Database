SHIPS: Tian An Men, U.S.S.
CLASS: 
REGISTRY: NCC-21382

A new starship, built in the wake of the massacre at Wolf 359, that was hauled out of Spacedock before it was completely finished in order to join the blockading fleet along the Klingon-Romulan border. It served in Picard's armada to blockade Romulan supply ships from supplying the Duras family during the Klingon civil war of 2367-2368. 
 
Reference: Redemption
The Tian An Men was named in honor of the many who died in the cause of Chinese freedom, much as the present-day U.S. Navy has a U.S.S. Lexington whose name celebrates the first battle in the American war for independence.
