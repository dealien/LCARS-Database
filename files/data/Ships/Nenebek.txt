SHUTTLECRAFT: Nenebek
TYPE:

A Pentarus V mining shuttle sent on stardate 44307.3 to convey Captain Picard and Ensign Crusher to a labor mediation on the planet. On the way, the shuttle malfunctioned, forcing them to land on one of Pentarus III's moons, called Lambda Paz, which had a desert environment. 

Reference: Final Mission 
The Nenebek was designed by Joseph Hodges and Rick Sternback. It was later re-dressed and served as several other ships, including Rasmussen's time-travel pod, Jaglom Shrek's Yridian craft, Taris Murn, and Koral's Toron-class Klingon shuttlecraft.
