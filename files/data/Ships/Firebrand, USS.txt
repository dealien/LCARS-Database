SHIPS: Firebrand, U.S.S.
CLASS: Freedom
REGISTRY: NCC-68723

A Starfleet vessel that served at Wold 359 against the Borg cube.

Reference: The Best of Both Worlds
The Firebrand was one of the ships in the graveyard scene after the Borg attack on Wolf 359. At the time of writing this entry I can't reall if it was actually seen, or if it was mentioned on a display screen aboard the Enterprise-D.
