PROBE: U.N.P. U Thant
Stellar-series probe

This probe was one of a series of successful spacegoing probes that relayed information back to Earth from the area outside of the Sol System. In 2017 this particular probe detected the presence of antimatter, confirming the theory of its existence. This discovery revolutionized the space travel sciences as it began to make the theory of warp travel possible, and revolutionized the energy sciences by offering a new source of materials from which to generate large amounts of energy.
Below is the telemetry recorded by U Thant upon its discovery:
Distance from Pluto: 120.4 A.U.
Speed: 0.104c
Elapsed time since Pluto flyby: 14 days
Distance from Barnard’s Star: 5.162 x 10^13 km
Time till Barnard’s Star: 2,449 days
Power system: 25.7% efficiency
Navigational system: 99.36% accuracy
Instrumentation: All monitors functioning
Communication system: Comp-sync laser at 98.1% opt
Propulsion system: Accepted performance levels
Interstellar dust readout:
H 90.7%
He 8.42%
H2O .46%
OH .29%
Fe .07%
Ni .05%
Ca .007%
Others .003%
Damage report: Interstellar gas collector ruptured by explosion- cause analysis: matter/antimatter annihilation.
Priority input- discovery: matter/ antimatter annihilation indicates detectable quantities of antimatter in interstellar void.
