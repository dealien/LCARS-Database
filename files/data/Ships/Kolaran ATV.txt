VEHICLE: Kolaran ATV

This all-terrain vehicle serves as the primary means of transportation for the Kolarans. 
Vehicle's occupants usually consist of a driver and a gunner, who mans the various arms situated at the rear or sides of the vehicle.
During a mission to Kolarus III, Picard, Data and Worf encountered the malicious Kolarans and evaded their ATVs with an ATV of their own, the Argo.
