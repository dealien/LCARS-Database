SHIPS: Mazarite vessel

The Mazarite captain of this ship opened fire on the Enterprise NX-01, in an effort to retrieve Vulcan Ambassador V'Lar for further questioning. Reed disabled the ship's engines with the NX-01's phase cannons. The Vulcan ship Sh'Raan entered the area and held back the other Mazarite vessels and transported V'Lar the rest of the way back to Vulcan.
