STATIONS: Mir Space Station

The Russian space station in orbit of Earth in the late 20th century. While not the first station, it followed Sky Lab, it was the first one to last its term in space. Its service helped set longevity records for manned hours of space living for that period of time. It was retired from service when it became to difficult and costly to maintain repairs, and from competition for resources from the new International Space Station. It remained in orbit for 15 years and was safely returned to a decaying orbit to burn up and land, five pieces, into the South Pacific ocean.
