CLASS: Phoenix
TYPE: dreanought

The Phoenix was originally developed by the Romulan Star Empire as a last resort, should the Romulans fall to invaders. Its potential effect is so devastating it requires a special shipyard for its construction. Because of the intense burden phoenix-class captains must bear, the Tal Shiar has been known to use unorthodox "conditioning" techniques in their training. These techniques ensure the loyalty and commitment of Phoenic captains to the Star Empire.
When the Phoenix activates its only weapon, it creates an expanding tear in the space-time continuum that does massive damage to any ship or station within range. The ship and its crew are destroyed in the resulting explosion.
