SHIPS: Columbia
CLASS: Enterprise
REGISTRY: NCC-02

The second version of Enterprise-class starship was still in drydock, undergoing construction, when the Enterprise NX-01 was sent into the Expanse to deal with the Xindi threat. 
In 2154, the Columbia, under the command of Captain Hernandez, aided Enterprise in its efforts to bring Trip over from Columbia to fix the NX-01's warp reactor. A device planted on the reactor prevented Enterprise from traveling below warp five or else the ship would explode. 
So the Columbia, at high warp, intercepted Enterprise, got into formation, and linked a cable between the two ships, thus allowing Trip -- while both vessels were at warp -- to travel to Enterprise.

This entry has been modified to state that it is an Enterprise-class vessel, and its registry is NCC not NX. It was stated that it was the same class as the Enterprise and not a new type of starship so it should not have an NX- or experimental- registry.
