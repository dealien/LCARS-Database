SHIPS: S.S. Belladonna

Research vessel assigned to the Oneo Madrin system in 2333. When it got too close to the accretion of the system's two stars, it sent out a distress call that was picked up by an Andorian research vessel and relayed to Starbase 63. Admiral Rayfield, in command of the starbase, ordered the U.S.S. Stargazer to assist the Belladonna and help her escape the accretion bridge's pull.  It was less than a hundred meters long.
