PROBE: Kataan

A small, automated probe, apparently launched during the same time as Earth's 14th century. 
The probe left Kataan shortly before its star went nova. In 2368, the Enterprise-D encountered the probe, and the probe then downloaded its historical record via a link to the mind of Captain Jean-Luc Picard. This link allowed Picard to experience the culture firsthand, over a native's lifetime compressed into 20 real minutes.
