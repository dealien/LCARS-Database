CLASS: Bradbury
TYPE: transport
REGISTRY: NX-72307

An experimental ship class, the first of its would-be design in 2366, assigned as a Starfleet Academy transport ship orbiting Betazed while waiting to pick up Academy cadets - including Wesley Crusher, who later decided to stay aboard the Enterprise. Named for 20th Century Earth science fiction author and futurist Ray Bradbury. 

Reference: Ménage à Troi 
The Bradbury was named for s-f/fantasy writer Ray Bradbury, a friend of the late Gene Roddenberry. Based on the ship's registry number we suspect it is an experimental vessel, the first of its class.
