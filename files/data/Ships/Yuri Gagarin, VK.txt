Reference: Up the Long Ladder
The ship was read from a list taken off the Enterprise-D's monitor. The captain actually is one of the Star Trek directors and his name was included as one of the many jokes around the set; the list was full of them. The name of the ship was probably paid in tribute to the Russian Cosmonaut that was the first human in space.
