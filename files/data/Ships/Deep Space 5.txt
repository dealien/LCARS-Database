STATIONS: Deep Space Five

Federation space station. Deep Space Five alerted Starfleet to the impending Borg invasion in 2373, after the Borg destroyed the Federation colony on Ivor Prime. The station was also the object of covert surveillance by the Cardassians in an alternate quantum reality visited by Worf in 2370. The station is located on the edge of Federation space, not far from the Romulan border, toward the center of the galaxy from Earth.
