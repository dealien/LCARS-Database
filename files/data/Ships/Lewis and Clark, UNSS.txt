This historic starship was the first manned Terran craft to travel to Saturn. Under the command of Colonel Shaun Jeffrey Christopher is made a geology survey of the rings of the gas giant planet and made some remarkable finds in 2020. The captain’s log states:
“A geological survey party has just returned from the Fourth Radian Moon Ring area breathless with extraordinary news. We are not the first visitors to these moons of Saturn. 
“On an orbiting asteroid approximately twenty kilometers in diameter, the survey party came across mine shafts. Yes, deep mine shafts drilled entirely through the rock. And the holes were perfect cylinders, probably cut with some laser-like apparatus alien to Earth technology. It seemed whoever mined this rock removed its contents like you would core an apple.
“But that’s not all! On a second moon, dotted with outcroppings of metallic salts, there were signs everywhere of surface activity. I have some holographs the mystified crew took, and I can clearly make out some type of tread marks and what looks like some old-fashioned strip mining scars.
“As yet, we have no estimation of the date this mining activity took place. Nor have we a clue as to who, or what, was exploring the moons of Saturn. But this much we do know. Unless there is still some undiscovered advanced industrial civilization hiding from our probes on the outer planets, we have been visited by an extrasolar race. A race of beings who not only carve up planetary bodies at will, can travel between the stars at will. Which means that somewhere out there is a civilization a hundred fold, a thousand fold, greater than we are. And the age old question has today been answered: indeed, man is not alone.”
