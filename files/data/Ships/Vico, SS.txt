SHIPS: Vico, S.S.

REGISTRY: NAR-18834

A vessel of civilian registry, which was destroyed while in the Black Cluster on stardate 45397.3, leaving only one young boy surviving. 

Reference: Hero Worship 
Because the starship had an S.S. Designation and it did not have an NCC-registry prefix, we assume it was not a Starfleet vessel, even though it was of Federation registry.
