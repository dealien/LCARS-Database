Early Terran spacecraft. A picture of this vessel could be seen on the refitted Enterprise being paid in honor to many different ships named Enterprise that came before that particular starship.
The vessel was an Earth/Vulcan design, featuring a main hull similar to that of the Valiant-class ships and featured two radial warp nacelles supported to the ship by a single pylon on the dorsal side of the craft.

This ship was pictured on the recreation deck of the refit Enterprise as a vessel previously named Enterprise.
