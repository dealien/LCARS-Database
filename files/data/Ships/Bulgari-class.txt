CLASS: Bulgari
TYPE: heavy cruiser

The flagship of the Breen fleet, these ships were frequently seen at the end of the Dominion War after that race joined the axis powers. These ships were fitted with an energy dampening weapon that neutralized Starfleet, Romulan, and Klingon ships and made them easy targets to destroy. Ablative armor and other shielding proved ineffective against the weapon. A random engine modification made by a Klingon warship did prove to be useful against the weapon, but it took considerable amount of time to duplicate its effects on Starfleet and Romulan craft. A fleet of these ships entered Earth space and laid heavy damage to San Francisco and the Presidio- Starfleet Headquarters in 23??
