CLASS: K`Vort
TYPE: light cruiser

A larger variety of the Klingon bird-of-prey ships, also seen in the alternate timeline of the 20-year war with the Federation. These are the latest, largest and most powerful of their birds-of-prey.
In some cases these ships have been able to defeat a Galaxy-class starship. Two K'Vort-class ships finished off the alternate U.S.S. Enterprise-D after a third was destroyed while the U.S.S. Enterprise-C sliped back through a temporal rift.
