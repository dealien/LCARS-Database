SHIPS: Yosemite, U.S.S.
CLASS: Oberth
REGISTRY: NCC-19002

Science vessel studying a plasma streamer in the Igo Sector whose crew was lost. During transport of plasma samples to the ship, quasi-energy microbes caused an explosion of a sample container resulting in severe damage to the ship. Due to a transporter accident, Lieutenant Barclay stumbled across the suspended forms of some of the crew on stardate 46041.1. 
The ship was later mentioned by the Tilonian asylum inmate Jaya, but just a part of the drugged Commander Riker's hallucination on stardate 46778.1.
