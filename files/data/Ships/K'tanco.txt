SHIPS: K'tanco, I.K.S.
TYPE: D-7

Kang's Klingon ship, of unspecified class and era.

Reference: Day of the Dove, The Sword of Kahless
It is assumed that the ship spoken of was used in the TOS episode, and that it was the same kind as Koloth and Kor's vessels since the three of them gained honor and glory at roughly the same time as each other.
