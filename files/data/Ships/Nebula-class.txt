CLASS: Nebula
TYPE: medium cruiser

A deep space exploration craft. Distinctive Starfleet design with nacelles on pylons hugging the saucer underside and a distinctive triangular wedge, located over the rear saucer, rather than an underside secondary hull. Obviously based on the Miranda-class of a century ago with high tech equipment making it similar in design to the Galaxy-class starships. This vessel overall is slightly smaller than the Galaxy-class but the saucer is the same size, as well as the secondary hull. 
Phasers can be emitted from the underside of the saucer. The warp engines of the class are rated at WF 9.5, but O'Brien coaxed those of the U.S.S. Prometheus up to 9.6. 
While these ships were originally designed for scientific research and exploration the class has been refitted for combat since the Dominion War. With an extensive array of multi-purpose weaponry and new technology at its disposal, the Nebula-class is a great compliment to the Federation fleet. It can be outfitted with three special weapons in addition to the traditional phasers and torpedo banks that includes a shield disruptor, Gemini Effect, and Point Defense Phaser. These ship are also crewed with additional engineering teams and special transporter protocols for assisting allied vessels.
