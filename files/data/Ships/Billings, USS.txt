SHIPS: Billings, U.S.S.

Kathryn Janeway and Tuvok served together on this ship at some point prior to being assigned to Voyager. During her tenure on the Billings, Janeway sent an away team to survey a volcanic moon - three members of the away team ended up critically injured. Feeling guilty, Janeway went on to complete the survey herself.
