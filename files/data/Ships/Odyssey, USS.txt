"ITS ORIGIN AND PURPOSE, STILL A TOTAL MYSTERY"
A Federation starship under the command of Captain Keogh. It was destroyed in a first encounter with the Jem'Hadar when one of the opposing fighters made a kamikaze run on its warp nacelle, its phased polaron beam punching through the starship's shields despite rotating shield harmonics. Civilians and non-essential personnel had been off-loaded at Deep Space Nine, and at the time of its destruction it had already sustained casualties on decks 4, 5, 8 and 17, a plasma leak in the port nacelle, major damage to Deck 7, and the loss of phaser power, external communications, and weapons control. 

Reference: The Jem'Hadar
The unnamed first officer of the Odyssey was played by Michael Jace. The Odyssey was named after the command module of Apollo 13. The starship motto is a quote from the sci-fi movie 2001: A Space Odyssey.
