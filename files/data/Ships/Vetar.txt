SHIPS: Vetar
CLASS: Galor

Gul Evek commanded this Cardassian warship. The Vetar was called at Dorvan V to unload the new occupying forces under treaty on stardate 47751.2. The Vetar was destroyed in the Badlands in 2371 when Evek's ship was not successful in navigating the plasma storms while in pursuit of Captain Chakotay's Maquis interceptor.
