SHUTTLECRAFT: Kazon

A Trabe design and smaller version of the Kazon raider composed of a polyduranide alloy. They can be armed with the Kazon blue phasers. The Kazon often use these as fighters against larger adversaries.
A one-man shuttle was easily defeated by a Federation shuttlecraft piloted by Commander Chakotay. Later, a Kazon shuttle collided with the U.S.S. Voyager, damaging the ship and enabling a Kazon boarding party to enter. Kazon-Ogla teen-ager Kal went after Chakotay in a small armed Kazon shuttle, but its shields were no match for a Federation shuttle's phasers; its engine core went critical stage in less than 45 seconds. The one Paris escaped in from Culluh's Kazon-Nistrim raider was destroyed. The Nistrim have one reinforced to break through Voyager's hull to steal a transporter component. Teirna arrived in one without life support and leaking noxious nitrogen tetroxide, as part of the Voyager takeover ruse. - Some were stowed after the Kazon-Nistim commandeering of Voyager, and one was used for escape by Culluh and Seska's baby.
