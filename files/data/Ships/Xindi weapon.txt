SHIPS: Xindi weapon

Humanity's first encounter with the Xindi weapon caught Earth off guard, as the spherical device fired upon the state of Florida from Earth's orbit. The ship's energy weapon cut through the state, killing seven million. 
And the weapon disappeared from where it came before the echo faded.
The weapon can travel at high speeds and features a unique, revolving series of rings that move in conjunction with the weapon's main power and propulsion.
Archer and the NX-01 Enterprise headed into the Delphic Expanse to locate the builders of the weapon and prevent another attack on Earth. After several trials and tribulations, Archer and his crew's mission was a success.
