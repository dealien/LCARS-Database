SHIPS: Excalibur, U.S.S.
CLASS: Ambassador
REGISTRY: NCC-26157 (or 26517)

The second starship to bear the name.
In early 2368 (Stardate 45020.4), the Excalibur was undergoing repairs and crew reassignment when it was hauled out of spacedock to join the blockading fleet along the Klingon-Romulan border. Captain Picard named Commander Riker and Chief Engineer La Forge to serve as its captain and first officer.
The starship was later assigned to Captain McKenzie Calhoun to offer humanitarian and diplomatic aide within Thallonian space after the collapse of the Thallonian government. 
The Excalibur was destroyed under mysterious conditions while still in Thallonian space.
