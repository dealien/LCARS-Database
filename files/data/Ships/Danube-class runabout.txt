CLASS: Danube
TYPE: Runabout
MODEL: MKZ-I
MISSION: Medium/ Long-Range Warp Shuttle

A multi-function small starship assigned to assist space stations and starbases with longer range or more elaborate duties than a shuttlecraft or shuttlepod could perform. Deep Space Nine was issued (and maintained) three of these starships assigned to it at a time. Some of these models feature a "roll bar" looking sensor array along the rear dorsal section of the craft.
This class has become the model for several variants including the Yellowstone-class, Chariot-class all terrain vehicle, and Seine-class.

The Danube-class was first seen in Emissary. These ships are traditionally named after great rivers. The Danube-class was designed by Rick Sternbach and Jim Martin; the interior cockpit by Joseph Hodges; the aft compartment by Richard James. The miniature was built by Tony Meininger. All design work was supervised by Herman Zimmerman. Although runabouts are primarily seen in Deep Space 9, Picard an company took a trip in an unnamed runabout in "Timescape" which was the only time to date that the aft compartment has been seen in an episode.
