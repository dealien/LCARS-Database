PROBE: Voyager I

In 1977 this probe, and its sequel Voyager II were launched for the outer planets of the Sol System. These probes were following up on data collected by their predecessors, the Pioneer probes. These more sophisticated probes encountered Jupiter (1979), Saturn (1980-81), and Uranus (1985). There were other Voyager probes to succeed this model, up through at least 6.
