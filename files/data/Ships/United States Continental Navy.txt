FLEET: United States Continental Navy

In October 1776, consisted of three schooners, four galleys, eight fifty-four foot gondalas, and a sloop-of-war (the Enterprise), sixteen ships in all. The fleet faced fifty-three British enemy ships at the Battle of Valcour Island on October 11. They fought valiantly from noon until sunset, but their losses were great. That evening all seemed lost until Captain Israel Daniel Dickenson of the Enterprise suggested that the fleet retreat under the cover of a fog which he foresaw emmanently flowing into the bay. They did so, and the British fleet didn't discover it until the following morning. The Continental Navy fled south.  {Historical accounts show, however, that the British fleet caught up with them, forcing a second bloody confrontation. Although many ships were lost, four ships (the Enterprise, the Schooner Revenge, the Galley Trumbull, and the Gunboat New York) survived to reach Fort Ticonderoga. 
One of the lost ships was the schooner Liberty.
