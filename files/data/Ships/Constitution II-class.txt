CLASS: Constitution II (refit)
TYPE: Heavy cruiser

A variant of the original Constitution-class, this starship included numerous enhancements to critical systems that became the standard for starship designs that followed. Newer warp nacelles and a more efficient main deflector dish were two of the most notable external features. The U.S.S. Enterprise was one of four starships to be commissioned as both a Constitution and a Constitution-II class vessel. Several of the original Constitution-class vessels were refit into this version after their original 20/25 year runs.

The name is conjectural but seems a likely name to make the distinction between the starship of the series and that of the movies.
