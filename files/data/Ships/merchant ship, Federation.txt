SHIPS: merchant ship, Federation

Unspecified ship attacked in the Demilitarized Zone by two Cardassian settlers' private attack craft who believed it to be bringing arms to the former United Federation of Planets colonists; Hudson later says it was bringing medical supplies to Soltok IV. It is saved by more rogue Federation ships - a battle Commander Sisko and Dukat view only by long-range sensors after detecting its distress call. Evek says it had refused to be boarded.
