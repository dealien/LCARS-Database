CLASS: Behemoth
TYPE: heavy cruiser

An extremely large biologic vessel used by Species 8472 and native to fluidic space. In those rare encounters within traditional space these vessels have been seen creating fluidic nebulas around them and the fleets they accompany making weapons locks and flight maneuvers difficult. While Species 8472 have been known to evolve vessels from active embryos, these are thought to be too large for that process and have only been seen after being brought into our space through a fluidic gate. It is speculated that these vessels are captured by Species 8472.
