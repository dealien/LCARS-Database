SHIPS: Sanction
TYPE: transport

An Oranaran vessel under the command of T'Jon. It traveled a trade route between Brekka and Ornara carrying the narcotic felicium. On one mission it lost orbit and disintegrated above the planet Brekka due to a drive coil malfunction. While the problem was minimal, however, the Ornarans were ignorant of the technology necessary to fix the problem.

The Sanction was a modification of the Batris from "Heart of Glory" which in turn was built from a Visitors' freighter from the miniseries V. It would appear that it was a popular design for ships in the galaxy.
