SHIPS: Q`Maire
TYPE: Heavy cruiser

A Talarian vessel with extended power fins on a flat angular body, referred to as a member of that race's warship class. This ship was under the command of Endar. This ship had limited weaponry which included neutral particle weapons, X-ray lasers, and Merculite rockets, not a serious threat to Federation starships.

TIMELINE:
2367: The Q'Maire intercepted the U.S.S. Enterprise-D in Sector 21947, near a disabled Talarian observation craft. The Q'Maire, along with two sister ships, surrounded the Federation starship in hopes of forcing the release of Endar's son Jono which was rescued by the Enterprise-D.
