SHIPS: Pegasus, U.S.S.
CLASS: Oberth
REGISTRY: NCC-53847

A starship used as a testbed for many of the features that went into the design of the Galaxy-class starships. It was Commander Riker's first assignment as an idealistic ensign under then-Captain Pressman. Those two and only seven others fled into escape pods in 2358 when the ship was lost - although a faked story of a core breach covered the fact that it had been a failed test of a covertly developed phasing cloak outlawed by the Treaty of Algeron from 2310, with the knowledge of some in Starfleet Intelligence. Those responsible were court-martialed once the secret was revealed when the ship was rediscovered years later in the Devolin system on stardate 47457.1.

The vessel was named for Greek mythology's famous winged Horse who is supposed to have sprung from the severed neck of Medusa.
