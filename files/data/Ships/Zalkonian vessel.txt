FLEET: Zalkonian vessels

These craft somewhat resemble an upside-down Phaser type-I. They are capable of at least warp 9.72 on a sustained basis. The Zalkonian ship that came to recapture "John Doe" was just as fast, maneuverable and armed as the Galaxy-class starship. 

Reference: Transfigurations 
The model for the ship appears to be the same model used for the Terellian Plague ship from "Haven" without the large sphere in the middle.
