SHIPS: Xindi-Insectoid

With a unique hull design featuring three insect-like pincers making up the forward hull, the Xindi-Insectoid vessels earn their namesake. 
These ships are arguably the most manuverable of Xindi vessels, capable of conducting quick, offensive attacks and evasive posturing.
The Insectoids joined forces with the Reptillians in an effort to prevent Archer of Enterprise from destroying the Xindi's doomsday weapon.
