SHIPS: Voth city ship

This giant community ship was basically a spacefaring city, about 11 kilometers in length and capable of space travel by way of a transwarp propulsion system. The massive city-ship was powerful enough to capture Voyager, and large enough to have an open area within it in which to suspend the craft.
The Voth population lived on the vast ship since they had no homeworld of their own in the Delta Quadrant. It is assumed that this ship was equipped with cloaking devices and other technology witnessed on their science ships.
