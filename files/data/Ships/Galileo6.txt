SHUTTLECRAFT: Galileo
TYPE: 6
REGISTRY: NCC-1701-D-

Attached to the U.S.S. Enterprise-D.
In 2364, this type-6 personnel shuttle was piloted by Lieutenant Tasha Yar to transport Captain Jean-Luc Picard to his new ship, the U.S.S. Enterprise NCC-1701-D.

Reference: All Good Things...
Naturally the writers of the episode named this craft in homage to the Galileo that served aboard the first Starship Enterprise. It also leads me to believe that all starships that assume the name of a previous vessel will assume the names of those shuttles as well.
