SHIPS: Torat's vessel

This small vessel was both home and office to Torat, a highly-regarded, Delta Quadrant astrophysicist. 
Torat's ship allowed him to discover 60 astronomical phenomena. Voyager encountered the vessel in Devore space, and Janeway asked Torat for information regarding an intermittent cyclic vortex in the sector. In exchange for the information, Janeway gave Torat mercurium isochromate, a compound necessary to power his ship.
