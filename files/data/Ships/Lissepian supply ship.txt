SHIPS: Liseppian supply ship

A supposed Maquis raid on this ship was really just an elaborate shapeshifter ruse to drive a wedge between Constable Odo and Major Kira while the two were on a deserted moon - and to convince Odo to rejoin the Great Link.

To what I clearly think is an error this is the entry on The Continuum for this entry:
A Starfleet starship of unspecified registry and class where Curzon Dax and Ben Sisko served together for months at some time during their 20-year friendship. On stardate 47182.1, they recalled one incident involving the ship's science officer, Kustanovich.
