Jem'Hadar Warship which also serves as base to a fleet of small fighter craft. Early on Weyoun used one of these as his flagship while he commanded the Dominion forces within the Alpha Quadrant. Guls Dukat and Dumar also commanded from this vessel type from time to time.
These formidable Jem`Hadar warships were encountered by the Federation in 2371, when the Defiant went looking for clues about the Dominion. The ships used ion propulsion, and like Jem'Hadar attack ships, featured shielding against tractor beams. Like many Dominion ships, these were not designed for comfort, and carried almost no cargo or safety gear, or even seats for the on-duty crew.
