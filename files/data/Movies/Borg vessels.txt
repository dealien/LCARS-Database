FLEET: Borg vessels

Borg vessels came in a variety of forms, most commonly geometrically-symmetrical designs embodying their monolithic mentality and their philosophy of perfection. Borg design was highly decentralized, with no specific bridge, engineering, or living areas. Their ships could analyze an opponent's weapons systems and adapt defenses within seconds and were capable of repairing major damage, including direct phaser hits almost immediately.
