TECHNOLOGY: magnetic probe

Handheld tool used by Starfleet engineers. After the Kalandan Losira sabotaged the engines of the U.S.S. Enterprise in 2268, causing the ship to accelerate to dangerously high warp speeds, Chief Engineer Scott used a magnetic probe to seal a flaw in the matter-antimatter flow and decelerate the ship.
