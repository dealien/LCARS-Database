FOOD: Flash packs

Starfleet ration packs containing heated field rations. Once a package was opened the sodium and magnesium additives reacted violently with the oxygen in the air causing energy to be released and the generation of heat from that chemical reaction. Various forms of flash packs have been available within military and civilian markets since the 1990s on Earth.
