These elements were used in special emitter units on Federation spacecraft. It was a tool used by Starfleet Engineering personnel. In 2368, Lieutenant Commander Data used a modified anyon emitter to remove chroniton particle contamination caused by a Romulan interphase generator from the U.S.S. Enterprise NCC-1701-D. The emitter was also used to return Chief Engineer La Forge and Ensign Ro to normal space from the phased condition in which they had been inadvertently trapped.
