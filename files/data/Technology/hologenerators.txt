TECHNOLOGY: hologenerator
also known as a hologram generator

Equipment used by a holodeck to create holographic images. In 2369, Quark mentioned to Security Chief Odo that he would like to expand the size of his bar so that he could use the bar's existing hologenerators to add more holosuite facilities. Rurigan used a hologenerator on planet Yadera II to create an entire village of people for company. Rurigans device employed a matter/antimatter reactor that used omicron particles to creates its images. So sophisticated was the hologenerator's software that the holographic people attained actual sentience and became bonafide life-forms. In 2370 the hologenerator began to malfunction, causing several holographic inhabitants to disappear. Chief Odo & Lieutenant Jadzia Dax were able to assist in repairing the system and restored the village's inhabitants. Hologenerators were used by Federation anthropological field teams to conceal planetary surface survey stations, duck blinds, from indigenous lifeforms. Use of the hologram generator allowed a team to observe such lifeforms at close range without the subjects being aware of the team's presence. The hologram generator used by the field team on Mintaka III failed in early 2366, resulting in accidental cultural contamination when the Mintakans saw the team and their advanced technology.
