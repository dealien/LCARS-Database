TECHNOLOGY: Ale synthesizer

Unit at Quark's bar used to make synthale. One of Quark's ale Synthesizers didn't work properly from the day he bought it until Nog had it fixed by the Cardassian engineer Berat for 300 credits.  After Berat fixed the machine in 2370, the machine made synthale so well, you'd swear it was the real thing.
