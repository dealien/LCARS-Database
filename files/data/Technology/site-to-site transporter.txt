TECHNOLOGY: site-to-site transporting

A process of beaming a person or object from a location not on a transpoter pad, to another location not on a transporter pad. Most transporter use involves starting or ending on a pad which increases transporter accuracy and reduces energy consumption, and is less of a burdon on the antenna system too. Intraship beaming refers to transporting between areas within the same starship, a process considered risky in the 23rd century due to less precise targeting and the chance of materialization within a bulkhead ro solid objectin close quarters. Eventually such transporting was refined for both emergency and routine site-to-site use.
