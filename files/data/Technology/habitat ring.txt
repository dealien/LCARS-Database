TECHNOLOGY: habitat ring

Part of the structure of Deep Space Nine. The habitant ring encircles the central core of the station, and is primarily filled with quarters and other living facilities for personnel. Three runabout launch pads can also be found on the ring. The defensive sails were also attached here, extending above and below the station at points in between the docking pylons.
