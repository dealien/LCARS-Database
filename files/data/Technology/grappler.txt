TECHNOLOGY: grappler

A retractable arm-and-cable piece of equipment attached to the Enterprise NX-01. The grappler is used to deploy equipment and to grasp and reel in objects, such as shuttles. The grappler used electromagnetic energy to hold its object and was not very useful when pulling a shuttlecraft from below a cometary surface; against gravity and physical blocks. Tractor beams proved to be far more effective.
