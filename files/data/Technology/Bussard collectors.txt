TECHNOLOGY: Bussard collectors

Also known as a ramscoop. Component of the warp drive nacelles of Federation starships, name for a 20th century Terran physicist who first theorized their operation. Located at the front of the nacelle, the collectors generate large electromagnetic fields that attract the hydrogen gas found in interstellar space which is then used for fuel by the vessel's fusion reactors. 
In 2365, the U.S.S. Enterprise NCC-1701-D discharged hydrogen back through the collectors into space. The discharge created a colorful but harmless display that frightened the Pakleds into releasing Chief Engineer Geordi La Forge from captivity aboard the Pakled ship Mondor. 
Chief O'Brien compared ramscoops to the arva nodes in Tosk's ship damaged in 2369, since the nodes served the same function.
