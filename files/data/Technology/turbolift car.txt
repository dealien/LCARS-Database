TECHNOLOGY: Turbolift Car

Part of the turbolift system, this item was the actual section that transported the people about the station or ship. By moving through the turboshafts and conducted by kinetic energy from conductors along the tube walls, these cars could reach incredible speeds. To offset the speed and sudden changes in motion the cars were equipped with inertial dampers and gravity plating of their own- separate from the main facility. 
On the U.S.S. Defiant the cars' main components were steel and ceramic planks.
