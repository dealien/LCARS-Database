CHEMISTRY: thoron

Also known as radon-220. Thoron emissions are radioactive isotopes created by the decay of thorium. Thoron emissions from the Denorios Belt increased following the appearance of unknown aliens at Deep Space Nine in 2369. Deep Space Nine was able to create thoron energy fields which helped to block outside sensors from scanning the station.
