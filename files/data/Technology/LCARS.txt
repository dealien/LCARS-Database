TECHNOLOGY: Library Computer Access and Retrieval System (LCARS)

Name of the main computer system within Federation installations.

Reference: Encounter at Farpoint
The official definition states that the LCARS is used on Galaxy-class starships. The same program has been seen on Voyager, in Starfleet Command, and other locations- and while they may have a different name it is unlikely.
