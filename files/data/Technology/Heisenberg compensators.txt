TECHNOLOGY: Heisenberg compensators

Part of the transporter that permits the derivation of positional data and precision vectors of particles on a subatomic level. 
Picard suggested diengagin the Heisenberg compensators as a possible means of giving physical reality to the computer intelligence version of Professor James Moriarty, but it was a ruse to buy time.

Warner Heisenberg's "uncertainty principle" suggests that on a subatomic level, it is possible to know the motion or the position of a particle, but not both. Some scientists have suggested this basic characteristic of matter may make it impossible for a transporter as seen on Star Trek to work, so Mike Okuda suggested the compensator as a bit of a scientific gag to explain how the transporter does it anyway.
