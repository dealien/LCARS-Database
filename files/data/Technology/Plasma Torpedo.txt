WEAPON: Plasma Torpedo

Weapon installed by the Romulan Star Empire aboard its birds-of-prey during the 23rd century.  The first one seen by the Federation was used against the Neutral Zone Outposts and the Enterprise NCC-1701 in 2266.  In 2268, the Klingon Empire attempted to buy the torpedo's technical specifications from Commander Teral.  The Enterprise got them from her in exchange for a pardon and full immunity.
