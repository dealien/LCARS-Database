TECHNOLOGY: warp field coils

A component of the warp drive system which actually forms a subspace "bubble" that the ship travels in at warp speed. They are comprised of multiple sets of paired toroids. Each toroid includes an injector through which the high energy plasma would be fueled into the middle of the coil area and warped.
