TECHNOLOGY: warp drive

The main propulsion system for most starships. It is capable of faster-than-light travel. The core of the warp drive uses dilithium crystals to control the annihilation of matter and antimatter. This controlled explosion is what generates the tremendous power required to warp space and travel faster than light. On Earth, warp drive was invented in 2063 by noted scientist Zefram Cochrane.
