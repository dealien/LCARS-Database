TECHNOLOGY: graviton field

Component of a tractor beam that enhances the structural strength of an object undergoing towing. In 2369, Deep Space Nine was endangered by an unknown life form contained inside an alien artifact that was capable of generating graviton fields. The crisis was resolved when the artifact was transported off the station, allowing the life form to emerge and disappear into the Bajoran wormhole.
