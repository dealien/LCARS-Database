TECHNOLOGY: Malkus Artifacts

Four devices of unimaginable power devised by the Zalkatian tyrant Malkus the Mighty.  After Malkus was overthrown, they were scattered across the Zalkat Union as they were indestructible.  After discovering the existence of these artifacts in 2151, both the Earth Starfleet and the Vulcan High Command formulated standing orders for their vessels to confiscate these objects immediately upon detection.
