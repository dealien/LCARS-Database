TECHNOLOGY: Delphic Expanse Spheres

These massive spheres, used by aliens and constructed out of a single alloy, located in the Delphic Expanse. The spheres' primary purpose is to convert space in the Expanse to make the space suitable for life by the invading aliens. 
The spheres emit gravimetric waves - when the waves intersect, physics-altering anomalies occur. These spheres also feature a deadly intruder defense system, as a MAKO fatally learned while crew members from the NX-01 Enterprise investigated a sphere.
The aliens have rigged their spheres with some form of cloaking device. It was estimated that there were at least fifty spheres located in the Expanse.
