TECHNOLOGY: recorder marker

A buoy with data-storage capability, also known as a flight recorder, carried aboard space vessels as a record of its activities in the event of cataclysmic loss. It is intended for use by investigators to gather evidence in the event of an accident involving or aboard the ship. 
Lieutenant Commander Nyota Uhura prepared such a buoy after the U.S.S. Enterprise had been engulfed within the energy cloud of V'Ger and before the ship entered the mechanical orifice leading to the inner chambers. The vessel was unable to send any messages to Starfleet Command to aprise them of their situation or findings due to communications interference. That buoy was never launched since it would not have escaped the tractor beam being used on the starship.
In 2265, the U.S.S. Enterprise found a marker from the S.S. Valiant. The Klingons of the 2360s also use such a system. In 2285, Admiral Kirk and Ambassador Sarek used recorder visual data to determine that Captain Spock had placed his katra into Dr. McCoy.
