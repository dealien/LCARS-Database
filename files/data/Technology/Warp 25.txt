TECHNOLOGY: Warp 25

Speed thought to be impossible, and directly translated into Federation scale as Warp 9.999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,9. Shortly before its destruction, the Furies’ ship Rath sent a message with that speed through an artificial subspace fissure to the Furies on the other side of the galaxy. 

Reference: First Strike  
The translation is conjectural to coincide with the fanish warp theory maintaining Gene Roddenberry’s rule creating a metric speed system and stating that Warp 10 is infinite.
