MEDICAL: Berengarian Virus

Enzyme presumably found on Berengaria that Marta Batanides was exposed to during her time at Starfleet Academy. It put her in a coma and nearly killed her. Without authorisation, Jean-Luc Picard and Corin Zweller secretly took her to Yrskatdon, where she underwent therapy involving gene resequencing, thus saving her life.
