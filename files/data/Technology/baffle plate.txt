TECHNOLOGY: baffle plate

Component of a Starfleet propulsion system, as with the U.S.S Antares. In 2266, Charles Evans caused the Antares to explode by making the baffle plate disappear. Another one that ruptured caused irreparable and disabling radiation damage to Christopher Pike during rescue of trapped cadets on a Class J training ship.
