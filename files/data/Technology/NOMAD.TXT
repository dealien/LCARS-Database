PROBES: Nomad

Early robotic interstellar probe launched from Earth in 2002 on a mission to search for new life-forms. Roughly cylindrical in shape, weighing 500 kilograms, and measuring about one meter in length, Nomad was created by brilliant Earth scientist Jackson Roykirk. Nomad was presumed destroyed in flight by a meteor collision. It was later learned that Nomad had in fact collided with an alien space probe called Tan Ru. In the aftermath of the accident, Nomad somehow repaired itself, merging its control programs with those of Tan Ru. The resulting combination of their benign programs became deadly. Nomad's new purpose was to seek out and sterilize what it deemed to be imperfect biological infestations. Nomad destroyed all living beings in the Malurian system in 2267, and shortly thereafter attacked the U.S.S. Enterprise. The deadly probe destroyed itself when it realized it was imperfect, having confused Enterprise Captain James Kirk with its creator, Jackson Roykirk.
