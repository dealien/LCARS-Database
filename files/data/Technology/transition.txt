TECHNOLOGY: Transition

The Pathfinders' term for the realm in which they exist. According to Mira Romaine, "Without input or current, their circuits would be unchanging, and they would have no perception. Their consciousness, their life, is change. Thus, they live in Transition." (See also Datawell.)
