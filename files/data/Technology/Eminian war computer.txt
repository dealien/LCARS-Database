TECHNOLOGY: Eminian war computer

A computer used to participate in a war with the Vendikans that uses a dedicated communications channel to keep in contact with a similar computer on Vendikar. The two computers receive war orders from their respective leaders then calculate casualties and damage as if the act had truly been done. It is then the expectation of each side to murder the appropriate amount of people. The computer decided that the starship Valiant was a casualty of a Vendikan attack and hence destroyed by the Eminians to keep the arrangement with the other race. The U.S.S. Enterprise was sent to investigate, and likewise was also considered a casualty, but Captain James Kirk would not allow his ship to be destroyed and fired on the computer, rendering it useless; and destroying one of the disintegration stations to prevent the deaths. This caused the two sides to begin peace talks again with the help of Federation Ambassador Robert Fox.
