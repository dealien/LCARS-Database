TECHNOLOGY: luvetric pulse

Form of energy that theoretically could be used to track Lieutenant Commander Data's location. The pulse would cause a detecting resonance fluctuation in his power cells. When Data was controlled by Lore in 2369, a luvetric pulse was considered to locate him, but discarded because the pulse would have risked destroying Data's positronic net.
