TECHNOLOGY: subroutine C-47

Subprogram of the U.S.S. Enterprise-D computer system that controls noncritical ship systems such as replicator choices and recreational applications. An interface experiment accidentally replaced C-47 with elements of Lieutenant Commander Data's programming, causing malfunctions in replicators, music libraries, and the holodeck.
