TECHNOLOGY: mind sifter

Klingon interrogation device that probes the minds of its victims. At high setting, the sifter causes irreversible brain damage. In 2267, Commander Spock was subjected to questioning by Klingon forces on Organia using a mind-sifter, but he was able to use Vulcan disciplines to endure the experience.
