TECHNOLOGY: flight recorder

An automated security log of ship’s activity. The recorder stores data and visual records from critical areas on a ship. It is intended for use by investigators to gather evidence in the event of an accident involving or aboard the ship. Information acquired by the various recorders would be backed up onto a recorder marker, also known as a beacon.
In 2285, Admiral Kirk and Ambassador Sarek used recorder visual data to determine that Captain Spock had placed his katra into Dr. McCoy.
