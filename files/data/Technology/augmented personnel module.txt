TECHNOLOGY: Augmented Personnel Module (APM)

Component of Deep Space Nine's cargo shuttle. The APM was stowed in its own bay just off the shuttle's freight hold. It was almost a complete small spacecraft -- 2 meters across and close to 4 meters from the base of its propulsion unit to the signal lights and sensors that were mounted above the multi-windowed head. Six utility arms positioned around the elongated trapezoidal form were equipped with a variety of tools, from heavy-duty grappling pincers to fusion weld cutters.
