TECHNOLOGY: intermix formula

Mathematical equation used to determine the proper mix of matter and antimatter in the warp core reaction chamber among starship propulsion systems. Artificial wormholes could result if the mix is applied incorrectly. In 2266, Science Officer Spock and Chief Engineer Scott accomplished an emergency restart of their starship's warp engines by creating a new formula based on a theoretical time/antimatter relationship. Although it saved the ship, the emergency move prompted a negative temporal shift of three days. Later, some of the warp drive upgrades supposedly being performed by Kosinski in 2364 called for varying the formula to improve engine performance. During the Starfleet Academy entrance exam participants are asked to identify the intermix ratio to power a starship for a certain speed and certain distance. Wesley Crusher identified this as a trick question since the answer will always be 1:1 regardless of vessel size, speed, or distance.
