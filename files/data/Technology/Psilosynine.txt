MEDICAL: psilosynine

A chemical found in the brain of a empath, such as a Betazed, or species that is capable of telepathy. 
Dr. Carter Greyhorse worked on the creation of synthetic psilosynine which the Betazoid scientist Turan Relanios claimed to have achieved. Greyhorse administered the substance to some Magnian "guinea pigs" to test its effects on their telepathic abilities.  
In 2370, the telepathic demands on Ambassador Lwaxana Troi, while working with the Cairn diplomatic delegation, became so demanding that her psilosynine level became dangerously low. Dr. Beverly Crusher manufactured a psilosynine inhibitor drug for Deanna Troi in 2370 during her investigation into Daniel Kwan's death. The inhibitor lessened the number of telepathic images Deanna received.

Officially the drug was given to Deanna while she was having hallucinations and was seen through her perspective, so the drug may or may not be real.
