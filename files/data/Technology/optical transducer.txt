TECHNOLOGY: optical transducer

Part of the VISOR worn by Chief Engineer Geordi La Forge. The transducers receives electromagnetic radiation from the surrounding environment and converts it into a bioelectric signal that the brain can comprehend. When La Forge was injured by a phaser shot in 2369, Dr. Beverly Crusher altered the transducer to reduce his pain by blocking the brain's own pain receptors.
