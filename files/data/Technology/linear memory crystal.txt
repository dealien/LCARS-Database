TECHNOLOGY: linear memory crystal

Component of an isolinear chip. This optically refractive material is a key part of data processing devices. Sentient nanites accidentally created by Ensign Wesley Crusher in 2366 consumed the crystals for food, which enabled them to reproduce and spread throughout the U.S.S. Enterprise NCC-1701-D.
