TECHNOLOGY: bio-neural gel packs

Advanced Federation technology which adds synthetic neural cells to a soft-sided circuitry module, designed to organize information more efficiently and speed up response time. The new feature is standard on Intrepid-class starships such as the U.S.S. Voyager. Their organic elements are, however, subject to damage from organic infection.
