TECHNOLOGY: Agony Booth

A raised platform in the middle of a bay with a cylindrical force field.  In the middle suspended like a puppet would hang the individual being punished.  Each agonizer is calibrated to the pain centers in its wearers brain and matched to his or her nervous system to the place where the person hurts the most.  In addition, the apparatus does a moment to moment evaluation of which nerves have overfired and need a rest to become sensitive again.
