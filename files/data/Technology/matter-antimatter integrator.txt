TECHNOLOGY: matter-antimatter integrator

Part of the warp drive system of Constitution-class starships, among others. The Kalandan Losira fused the emergency bypass control valve of the integrator on the U.S.S. Enterprise NCC-1701 in 2268, causing the ship to accelerate up to warp 14.1 (old scale) before repairs brought it back under control.
