TECHNOLOGY: pattern enhancer

Portable Starfleet devices used to amplify the signal lock of transporter signals in hazardous conditions, such as electrical storms. Enhancers are typically deployed in groups of three, placed in a triangular pattern around the subjects to be transported. Transporter Chief O'Brien used enhancers in 2368 to rescue an away team stranded on a moon of Mab-Bu VI.
