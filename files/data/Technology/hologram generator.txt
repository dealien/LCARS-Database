TECHNOLOGY: hologram generator


Device used to conceal anthropological teams and their survey sites from native planetary life forms, so that the anthropologists can make observations without being detected. In 2366, the generator at a Mintaka III station failed, caused cultural contamination when the Mintakans captured a member of the anthropology team stationed on that planet.
