TECHNOLOGY: Genesis Project

Project Genesis was a theoretical process to terraform dead planets by means of a genetic explosion that would reduce the surface of a planet to its elementary particles. 
Phase 1 was to be conducted in a laboratory setting. Phase two was to be performed within a small moon or similar underground setting, and was conducted on Regula, a class-D planateoid in the Mutara Sector.
The Regula 1 station was created in orbit of Regula for the team's usage to employ and monitor the project's progress. The U.S.S. Reliant was assigned to search for a lifeless planet for which to conduct the third and final phase of the project. While scanning the Ceti Alpha system the crew of the Reliant attempted to take a closer look at Ceti Alpha VI, only to learn that it had been destroyed and was replaced by Ceti Alpha V in its orbit path. 
Under the direction of Dr. Carol Marcus and Dr. David Marcus this theory was successfully run on the nearby planet Regula. The device was subsequently stolen by Khan Noonian Singh in his revenge plans against Admiral James T. Kirk and was detonated inside the Mutara Nebula, thus creating the unstable Genesis planet. The project was deemed a failure when the planet began to break down due to the usage of unstable protomatter in the original matrix. 
The energy from the project did continue to cause changes within the Mutara sector, including the reformation of the Mutara Nebula and several space-borne species.
The project was originally designed to be employed through the use of a torpedo-style device.
