TECHNOLOGY: weather modification net

Technology used to detect and neutralize dangerous weather conditions. It is a series of satellites in orbit.
One such net did not detect a tornado on a planet in the Bilaren system that killed the biological parents of Amanda Rogers. That tornado was later blamed on the Q Continuum. Earth was equipped with such a system, as was Risa, whose natural climate involved lots of rain. Political dissidents convinced Worf of their cause and he created a device to override the net, which deactivated the satellites.
