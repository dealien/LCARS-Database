TECHNOLOGY: Subspace Field Generator

Constellation class Starships like the U.S.S. Stargazer featured eight such devices - two on deck 10, two on deck 26, and one in each of the four warp nacelles. Each generator consisted of a dozen graviton polarity sources feeding a pair of 500-millicochrane subspace field distortion amplifiers. Subspace field generators on Oberth class ships were a full level of sophistication below those on Constellation class explorers. The Stargazer’s subspace field generators were damaged when the ship tried to cross the vortex belt around Beta Barritus.
