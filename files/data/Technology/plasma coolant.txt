TECHNOLOGY: plasma coolant

A gas used near matter/antimatter reaction chambers to cool the high energy plasma created as a result of mixing the alternate reality matters. The coolant is extremely hazardous to fleshy materials and will eat off skin and other similar surfaces.
Lieutenant Commander Data broke one of the containers funneling the coolant through main engineering on the U.S.S. Enterprise-E. The coolant engulfed the surrounding Borg drones and the Queen that had taken over the starship in an attempt to change Earth history. Data had undergone some replacement of his dermal plating and lost that in the incident.
