FOOD: millipede juice

A green Ferengi beverage made of bug squeezings. Sometimes includes shells. Quark ordered one from Rom's room replicator -- "without the shells." 

Neelix- "The Ferengi like to start off each day with the juice of a hard-shelled insect. It's pure protein and gives them the oomph they need to strike the kinds of deals that would cross the eyes of most galactic traders. I'm not especially fond of millipedes myself, but I can whip up a clam-juice cocktail that does the same thing for me that a millipede does for Quark. You can have your clam juice two ways; one, warm and straight-up with a twist of lemon; and two, mixed with tomato or vegetable juice. Either way, start with about a dozen chowder clams, which you wash and steam. Then draw off the juice and strain to remove the sand. Serve the juice nice and hot with lemon. Raw clam juice too strong? After you've drawn the juice and strained it, chill it for about 1/2 hour and combine it half-and-half with vegetable or tomato juice, lemon, and a smattering of salt and Tabasco. Serve it over ice to start the day, and watch out world.
