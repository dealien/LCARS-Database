PROBES: Bok's probe

This is a small probe whose general purpose is unknown. But it was used by Daimon Bok to transmit holographic images to Captain Jean-Luc Picard.

Reference: Bloodlines
We don't know if Bok's probe from TNG: "Bloodlines" is a standard Ferengi probe, although this seems very likely, considering that it accomplished nothing more than relaying holographic messages to Picard.
