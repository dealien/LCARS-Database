PROBE: Destroyer

Xindi ship used to attack Earth in March 2153. It consisted of two concentric spheres rotating within each other and had two purposes: to relay information to the Xindi Inner Sanctum, and to destroy. It was piloted by a Xindi Reptilian of the highest warrior class. After the test fire on Earth proved successful, the self-destruct engaged, but one charge did not detonate, meaning enough of the vessel was left intact to be analyzed by Earth scientists. The remnants crash-landed in Central Asia, where they were recovered by a Vulcan transport.  Captain Jonathan Archer was able to discover that at least one component of the probe had been manufactured in the year 2573, proving the Xindi had had assistance from the future.
