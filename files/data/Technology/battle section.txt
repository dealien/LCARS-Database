TECHNOLOGY: battle section

Synonym for a Galaxy-class starship's stardrive section. It is also known as the engineering hull, or secondary hull. The battle section is the module containing the warp engines that remains after the saucer section has separated. It contains the torpedo launchers and a series of phaser arrays giving it the majority of the weapons after separation. It got the name battle section since it would be the part that would go into battle while allowing the remainder of the ship to go off toward safety.
The battle section was most useful during the infamous incursion with the Borg, following the slaughter at Wolf 359. Captain Riker was forced to separate the saucer section in an effort to attack and distract the Borg from his attempt to rescue a kidnapped Picard, who himself was aassimilated by the Borg into Locutus.
