TECHNOLOGY: phase discriminator

Device that is a component of various systems and comes in several types. The positronic brain of Lieutenant Commander Data had a type-R discriminating amplifier. The brain of the android Lore had a type-L amplifier. A handheld version was used to adjust an away team from the U.S.S. Enterprise NCC-1701-D to the time continuum of the Devidians. Starfleet emergency transporter armbands contain a type-7 discriminator. With the discriminator, the armbands can be modified to create subspace forcefields around the wearer.
