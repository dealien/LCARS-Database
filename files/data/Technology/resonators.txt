TECHNOLOGY: resonators

Mechanisms that create powerful underground planetary oscillations. In 2365, the U.S.S. Enterprise NCC-1701-D modified several class-1 probes to function as resonators. Sent below the surface of planet Drema IV, the resonators' vibrations destroyed the dilithium lattices prevalent throughout the geological structure of the world and saved it from disintegration.
