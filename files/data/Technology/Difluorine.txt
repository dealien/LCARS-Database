CHEMISTRY: Difluorine

The most reactive and the most unstable of the transperiodic elements. Used as a chemical weapon by the Unclean. Difluorine can slice through duranium in hard vacuum and 2° Kelvin. Difluorine can cause duranium to disintegrate. Difluorine mixed with water produced the most corrosive acid known to science, powerful enough to chew through a starship's hull.
