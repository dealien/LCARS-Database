CHEMISTRY: Hyperdimensional String

Also called a hyperstring, can be an electron, a proton, or a verteron, depending on which way one looks at it. Hyperdimensional, non-physical structures on which the matter and the energy of the universe are strung like beads. The strands are dense cold matter that drift about in real space. Still unproven, but the theoretical work suggests that when something happens to a physical object, the hyperstring structures attached to it resonate with the change.  They resonate both forward and backward in time.
