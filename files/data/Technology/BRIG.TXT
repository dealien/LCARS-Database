TECHNOLOGY: brig

Old Terran naval designation for a ship's detention area for the holding of suspect individuals. On starships and other facilities, forcefields are used to bar individual cells and sometimes the brig area entirely. Other cultures use other methods to occupy the attention of their inmates, like on Vulcan where detainees are held in mediation suites. Engineers often need to upgrade their facilities regularly and need to test those improvements on "the most resourceful individuals they can find." Captain Spock served as a guinea pig for upgrades made to the facilities on the U.S.S. Enterprise-A.
