MEDICAL: Kelpwilt

A disease that strikes and destroys kelp. Kelpwilt spreads quickly and once detected it is almost impossible to stop. Sorahl developed a cure for kelpwilt while on board the C.S.S. Delphinus which he gave to Yoshi Nakamura. Since kelp was a major food source on Earth in the 21st century, kelpwilt was extremely serious.
