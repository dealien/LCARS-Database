TECHNOLOGY: ion propulsion

Spacecraft drive system that used magnetic fields to drive electrically charged gases. Ion propulsion was used in early Eath spacecraft like the Deep Space One probe and Class F shuttlecraft in the 2260s, but its application by a ship from Sigma Draconis VI left Montgomery Scott speechless upon first contact in 2268. Its ion wake was easily detectable. Jem'Hadar warships use ion thrusters for secondary propulsion.
