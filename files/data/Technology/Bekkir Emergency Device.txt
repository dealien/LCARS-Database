TECHNOLOGY: Bekkir Emergency Device

Device used by the Bekkir in times of distress.  The device was larger than a hand phaser, yet smaller than a tricorder.  It was shaped roughly like a sharply angled hand-sized belt buckle.  Tiny sucker pads made it stick to surfaces it was placed on.  The device was made out of a dark gray material, somewhat between metal and plastic.  It was light, strong, yet malleable.  The device had no obvious button, but there was a vortex surrounding it.  Activation of the device would send the user ahead in time 2 days.  When the user was certain that they were out of danger, they would use the device to travel exactly 2 days back in time.
