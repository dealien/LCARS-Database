TECHNOLOGY: Insadja'tu

A stone inscribed with Gnalish glyphs that is used in the Gnalish Procreation Ritual. Participants of that ritual are summoned by insadja'tus sent to them. The winner of the ritual race has to reproduce the glyphs on his stone before he can inseminate the eggs.  Lieutenant Phigus Simenon lost his insadja'tu during the race, but Dr. Carter Greyhorse managed to draw the glyphs from memory.
