CHEMISTRY: lithium

Atomic element #3. Because the rare crystalline form was required, lithium so used had to be refined thourgh an energy-intensive "cracking" process. In some cases small lithium crystals are used as medicine for mental stability.
Recent science upgraded to the more rare dilithium, paired molecules for channeling warp energies. And emerging science is researching trilithium molecules which have proven to be very dangerous.
