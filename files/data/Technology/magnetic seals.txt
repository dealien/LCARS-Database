TECHNOLOGY: magnetic seals

Part of the matter/antimatter containment system aboard Federation starships. The seals prevent the antimatter from making contacting with the ship's structure and destroying the vessel. The U.S.S. Yamato was destroyed in 2365 when its seals failed. The emergency system that would have ejected the antimatter from the ship in the event of a seal failure also did not function.
