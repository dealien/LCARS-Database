TECHNOLOGY: Portal

A security sentry left over from the fallen TKon Empire. The sentry was assigned to protect a planet in the Delphi Ardu system of space. While the U.S.S. Enterprise-D chased a Ferengi Marauder after stealing from a Federation outpost, the two entered the system and were captured by the sentry. While investigating the origins of the energy draining weapon, landing teams were sent from both craft to the planet. After a confrontation with the Ferengi enemy, a mysterious being known only as Portal, guardian of the Tkon Empire, materializes before both away teams inquiring, "Who will meet the challenge?" Portal, disenchanted with the Ferengi's barbaric and warlike responses to his inquisition, is intrigued by Commander Riker's wisdom. Once Riker passes several of Portal's intellectual "tests," power is again restored to the respective starships.
