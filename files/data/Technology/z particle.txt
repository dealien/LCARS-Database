CHEMISTRY: Z PARTICLE
 
Z particles are one of the carriers of the weak nuclear force. They are emitted by vessels, especially those using relatively poor versions of cloaking technology. Z particle emissions were used to determine the location of Ardras vessel in orbit around Ventax III by the crew of the Enterprise-D.
