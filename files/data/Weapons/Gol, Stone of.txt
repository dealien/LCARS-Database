WEAPONS: Stone of Gol

An ancient Vulcan artifact, a powerful weapon dating back to the Time of Awakening, some 2,000 years ago. Long thought to be mere legend, the stone was a psionic resonator that operated by focusing and amplifying telepathic energy, enabling its bearer to kill by telepathy, turning an opponent's violent thoughts and emotions against him. The Stone of Gol was actually three interlocking artifacts covered with ancient Vulcan glyphs and symbols. These writings mostly warned of death to anyone who opposed the stone, but one set of three glyphs showed the symbol for war and the symbol of the god of death, dearated by the symbol for peace. According to legend it was destroyed by the gods when the Vulcan people found the way of peace. The stone had, in fact, been dismantled, with one piece placed in a Vulcan museum. The remaining two peices were lost and presumed destroyed. In 2369, extremists from the Vulcan Isolationist movement stole the first fragment and hired Arctus Baran to find the two remaining pieces. Baran raided numerous Romulan archaeological sites throughout the Quadrant, and by early 2370 had located all three peices. Baran's employers were prevented from using the device, and later, Vulcan authorities vowed that they would destroy the three pieces of the resonator once and for all.
