WEAPONS: engine overload

This unique defense weapon was designed for the slow moving starships of the Starfleet. Steamrunner-class vessels have long suffered to engagements since they have been slow to move after an attack. This new weapon gives them the extra time they need to counter the attack or to flee a position they are in. The weapon specifically targets the engines of an enemy ship and causes them to temporarily overload and shut down. An enemy may still function on battery power which often means their weapons are still online, but their propulsion is offline. The enemy targets are now as slow to respond to movement changes as the Steamrunner. Captains may now choose to use their weapons on the stranded target or to flee the situation before other reinforcements arrive.
