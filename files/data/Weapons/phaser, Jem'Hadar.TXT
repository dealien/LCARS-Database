WEAPONS: Phaser - Jem-Hadar

A pulsed polaron beam weapon coming in a pistol and rifle style weapon used by the genetic army of the Dominion.
Starfleet engineers and weapons experts are continuing to study captured Jem'Hadar weapons. Neither weapon, pistol or rifle, possess configurable energy settings; only a killing discharge level is emitted from the weapons. The mechanism used by the Jem'Hadar appears to center on a pulsed polaron beam generator, though a surrounding burst of high-energy gamma radiation often accompanies the polaron discharge. The gamma EM may be a result of fluctuations in the delivered pwer from the energy cells. Power is generated by a tritium microfusion reaction along the discharge centerline, and the energy is channeled into a phased polaron source, which holds an accumulated charge, in similar fashion to the Starfleet phaser prefire chamber. The process is automatic; by manufacture, the pent-up polaron charge tunnels through the emitter, a precisely shaped parabola of solid arkenium.
In certain instances, chemical enhancements can be added to the particle stream, including nerve agents, anticoagulants, and osteosolvents. In the event that an energy shot does not immediately cause death, the chemical diminishing an opponent's forces by causing them to attend to their wounded appears to be well known to the Jem'Hadar. The total charge contained in the pistol is approximately 5.4 x 10^8 megajoules, and 1.54 x 10^9 megajoules in the rifle. Of particular importance is the ongoing effort to protect Starfleet and Bajoran assets against attacks using energetic polaron beams, which have historically defeated various defensive shield configurations.
