WEAPONS: compressed tetryon beam

Energy weapon used by Lenarians in 2369 in assaulting an away team from the U.S.S. Enterprise NCC-1701-D. Captain Picard was hit by the near-fatal attack and suffered injuries to his spleen and liver as well as damage to the bio-regulator in his artificial heart. Security scanners on station Deep Space Nine do not normally detect such weapons. A compressed tetryon beam weapon was used to attack Quark in 2370.
