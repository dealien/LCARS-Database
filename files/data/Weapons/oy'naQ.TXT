A Klingon painstick more used for ceremonial purposes than as a weapon. The electronic "cattle-prod" is used as part of the Klingon Age of Ascension ritual. The use of the painstick is significant because endurance of physical suffering is considered a Klinong spiritual test. O'Brien recalled that he saw a painstick used on a two-ton Rectyne monopod, and that the creature jumped five meters before dying of excessive cephalic pressures. Painsticks were also used in the Sonchi ceremony to provide proof that an individual was dead. Commander Troi was under the impression that painsticks were used as part of a Klingon birthday celebration.
