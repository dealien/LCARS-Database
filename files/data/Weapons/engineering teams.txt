WEAPONS: engineering teams

During heavy combat Nebula-class cruisers are often used in the frigate role of armada deployments. This affords them a bit more protection than a front line cruiser which protects their special technology from incoming attacks better. Since the ship suffers less damage than others, their repair crews are generally less busy than other starships and are then used to supplement the crews of other, damaged ships. By sending over repair teams damaged ships can repair their damage quicker and can regenerate their shields sooner than if left to their own devices.
