WEAPONS: Gemini Effect

This weapon was developed as a result of the temporal research performed by Dr. Paul Manheim. This technology, turned into a weapon, can be adapted to fit onto a Nebula-class cruiser and used in armada deployments. Engaging the weapon creates a temporal disturbance in the space-time continuum that allows a target vessel to appear in two simultaneous positions. This short term weapon can effectively create another starship with which to target against any enemy vessel.
