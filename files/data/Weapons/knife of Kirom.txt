WEAPONS: knife of Kirom

Ancient Klingon relic stained with the blood of Kahless the Unforgettable, according to Klingon legend. 
In 2369, Gowron used the bloodstains to determine if the clone of Kahless created by Boreth clerics was indeed legitimate. The clone's genetic pattern proved to be a match with that from the blood from the knife.
